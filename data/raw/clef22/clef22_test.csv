"A coalition of civil society groups has described the proposed Control of Infectious Diseases Bill as a threat to human rights. The group, 41 in total, said the House of Representatives must subject the bill to public scrutiny by embarking on stakeholders’ consultations and a public hearing to harness public inputs into the legislation. Many Nigerians had criticised a move by the House of Representatives to repeal the Quarantine Act and replace it with the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill. The bill, which scaled second reading before it was stood down last week, has 82 sections. Sponsored by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, the bill seeks to strengthen the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and make it more proactive and “not just reactive and function when there is an outbreak.” The bill seeks to empower the president, the minister of health as well as the director-general of NCDC, and the institutions they head, to make regulations on quarantining, vaccination and prevention of infectious diseases in Nigeria. CSOs position In a statement issued on Tuesday, the groups said the bill empowers NCDC to restrict fundamental rights and freedoms of the people. “The Bill empowers the NCDC to restrict fundamental rights and freedoms at will, and abuse constitutionally established institutions and processes, without any form of accountability. “For instance, Section 10 (3) gives the Director-General express powers to use force to enter any premises without a warrant,” it said. The group also said the bill violates key principles of legislative drafting rules mandating laws to be simple, clear and unambiguous. It, therefore, demanded the immediate review of all provisions of the bill. “The Bill violates key principles of legislative drafting rules mandating laws to be simple, clear and unambiguous. “This leaves room for significant amount of discretion on the part of the implementing authorities and limits the rights of citizens and respective institutions to question decisions taken in the exercise of the powers provided in the Bill. “We demand a review of all provisions of the Bill that foster inter-agency conflicts and abuse of power and undermine constitutionally guaranteed rights and are contrary to the rule of law and Nigeria’s international human rights obligations.” The groups include: Girl Child Africa, Center For Liberty, Centre for Democracy and Development, Civil Society Legislative Advocacy Centre, Say No Campaign, Amnesty International, YIAGA Africa, Human and Environmental Development Agenda, Global Rights and African Centre for Media and Information Literacy. Others are International Press Centre, Lawyers Alert, Women Advocates Research and Documentation Centre, Enough is Enough, Community Life Project, Centre for Information Technology and Development, Centre for Impact Advocacy, Concerned Nigerians, Lex Community NG, Education as a Vaccine, Dinidari Foundation, Albino Foundation, The Community of PWDs in Nigeria, Dorothy Njemanze Foundation, Tap Nitiative for citizens development, Raising New Voices Initiative, Haly Hope Foundation, Youths Concerns Development Foundation, Adopt A Goal For Development Initiative, Coalition in Defence of Nigerian Democracy and Constitution, PITCH Nigeria, House of Justice, Molluma Medico-Legal Centre, Albino Foundation, The Community of PWDs in Nigeria, Alliances for Africa, Youths in Motion, Persons with Disabilities Action Network, Silverchip Fox, Community Action for Popular Participation and Resource Centre for Human Rights & Civic Education. Allegations On Tuesday, Mr Gbajabiamila said the allegation that the bill is a sinister attempt to turn Nigerians into guinea pigs for medical research while taking away their fundamental human rights was far from the truth. He said as representatives of the Nigerian people, members of the House would never contemplate doing anything that would jeopardise the wellbeing of the citizens. ADVERTISEMENT He promised that a public hearing would be conducted during the consideration of the bill.",TRUE
"A Catholic school in Kentucky has condemned a group of its students after they were recorded harassing a Native American Vietnam veteran in a video that went viral on Saturday. The students, many of whom were wearing “Make America Great Again” caps, from private, all-male Covington Catholic High School in Park Hillswere in Washington for an anti-abortion rally on Friday when they were filmed surrounding Nathan Phillips and mocking the Native American’s singing and drumming. One teen in particular is seen standing in front of Phillips, staring into his face with a smile. Fellow students, many in hats and sweatshirts with President Donald Trump’s “MAGA” slogan, cheered him on and chanted, “build the wall, build the wall”, Phillips said. The footage was shared online by organizers of an indigenous peoples’ march that also took place on Friday. The video prompted a torrent of outrage online. Actress and activist Alyssa Milano tweeted that the footage “brought me to tears”, while actor Chris Evans tweeted that the students’ actions were “appalling” and “shameful”. In a joint statement, the high school and Diocese of Covington condemned the actions of the students “towards Nathan Phillips specifically, and Native Americans in general”. “We extend our deepest apologies to Mr. Phillips,” the statement read. “This behavior is opposed to the Church’s teachings on the dignity and respect of the human person.” “The matter is being investigated and we will take appropriate action, up to and including expulsion.” Covington Mayor Joe Meyer, a Democrat, said the “appalling” footage had rightly inspired “a tidal wave of condemnation” and that his town was now being linked with “intolerance and ethnic intimidation” because of the boys’ actions. “The videos being shared across the nation do NOT represent the core beliefs and values of this city,” he said in a statement. In a separate video uploaded to social media, the 64-year-old Phillips, an elder of Nebraska’s Omaha tribe, wiped away tears as he described the incident. “I heard them saying ‘build that wall, build that wall’. These are indigenous lands, we’re not supposed to have walls,” he said. “I wish I could see that energy of that young mass of young men, put that energy into making this country, really, really great, helping those that are hungry.” He told The Washington Post that while he was drumming, he thought about his wife, Shoshana, who died of bone marrow cancer nearly four years ago, and the threats that indigenous communities around the world are facing. “I felt like the spirit was talking through me,” Phillips said. Phillips holds an annual ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery to honor Native American veterans, according to media reports. He is a well-known Native American activist who was among those leading the Standing Rock protests in 2016-2017 against the construction of an oil pipeline in North Dakota. Democratic US Congresswoman Deb Haaland, a member of New Mexico’s Laguna Pueblo tribe, said on Twitter that Phillips had risked his life for his country, and that the students showed “blatant hate, disrespect, and intolerance”.

"Beaumont, Texas | An employee of the Jefferson County morgue died this morning after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers. According to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight. While he was sleeping, another employee mistook him for the corpse of a 52-year-old car accident victim and carried him to the crematory. Before anyone could notice the mistake, he had already been exposed to temperatures ranging between 1400 to 1800 degrees Fahrenheit and reduced to ashes. Jenna Davis, one of Henri Johnson’s coworkers, says she heard him scream for about 15 seconds after the crematory was activated. “At first, we didn’t understand where the sound was coming from. When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.” Ms. Davis claims that the young coworker who caused the accident was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body. The police have opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Johnson’s death. Investigators have not ruled out the possibility of filing criminal charges against the employee who caused his death. The young man could possibly be accused of criminal negligence causing death.",FALSE
"Senate Democrats Fail Taxpayers, Local Governments, Job Seekers, and Middle-Class Families; Instead, they Deliver for Criminals, Illegal Immigrants, and the Far Left Fringe  Crafted entirely by Democrats in total control of New York’s new one-party government, the 2019-20 state budget includes billions of dollars in new taxes and spending that will make it even more difficult for hardworking, middle-class taxpayers to provide for their families and make ends meet.  The budget includes a multitude of unfunded mandates that will drastically hamper the viability of local governments, and will also enact catastrophic changes to New York’s criminal justice system which will enhance the rights of dangerous criminals over law-abiding citizens.  “After months of warning about the disastrous effects of one-party government, New York’s worst nightmare has been realized with the 2019-20 state budget. Not only have Senate Democrats betrayed the hardworking taxpayers they are supposed to represent – they have focused virtually all of their energy on delivering for criminals and illegal immigrants, and appeasing the radical, socialist fringe that now controls their party. By voting for this disastrous spending plan, Democrats have totally turned their backs on local governments and middle-class families struggling through New York’s growing affordability crisis. Our great state deserves a much better budget,” said Senate Republican Leader John J. Flanagan.  New taxes and fees to be enacted by Senate Democrats in the state budget include:  A new tax on internet purchases, with an overwhelming majority of the revenue raised to be funneled to fund New York City priorities;  A new tax on prescription drugs and medications, which would harm seniors and our most vulnerable populations;  A new commuter tax that will hurt motorists in the Hudson Valley and on Long Island;  A new tax on driving that will devastate Upstate New York’s tourism industry;  A new tax on real estate transactions;  A new grocery bag tax, which will require anyone who needs food or other basic necessities to dig a little deeper into their pockets; and  A planned taxpayer-funded political campaign system, AKA “welfare for politicians,” through actions to be implemented by a commission which will ultimately require taxpayer dollars to fund negative campaign mailers and robocalls.  Senate Democrats once promised they wouldn’t raise taxes, but instead picked up right where they left off in 2009-10, when they raised taxes and fees 124 times, totaling $14 billion in just two years. The fiscally irresponsible trend continues today with the imminent passage of the state budget, as Senate Democrats are approving billions in new taxes that are still being tabulated. On top of accelerating the affordability crisis plaguing millions of New Yorkers who have been forced to leave for more affordable areas of the country, the spending plan does nothing to address the Senate Democrats’ outright rejection of the Amazon HQ2 plan, which cost New York 25,000 new jobs and $27 billion in new revenue.  The budget includes no increase in CHIPs funding and cuts to extreme winter recovery funds by $65 million, while fronting the MTA $100 million to pave the way for implementation of the new commuter tax. It also cuts AIM funding by $59 million, and for the first time ever, the budget awards Governor Cuomo with $5 million in bullet aid.  Since the beginning of the 2019 session, Senate Republicans have offered various amendments and proposals to these job-killing tax-and-spend policies, including:  Balancing the budget without raising or creating new taxes and fees;  Enshrining the state spending cap into law, which would ensure that Democrats can never again blow past fiscally responsible levels concerning how they spend the taxpayer dollar;  Accelerating and protecting the historic Middle Class Income Tax Cut previously enacted by Senate Republicans, which has already saved New Yorkers $770 million, and is one of the largest and most important tax cuts in state history;  Implementing significant business and energy tax cuts and regulatory reforms, so that there are fewer obstacles to creating new jobs in New York;  Reforming the voting procedure for the Public Authorities Control Board to require a majority vote on economic development projects, so that any one Senator can never again single-handedly cost New York thousands of jobs and billions in new revenue due to political considerations.  Despite many assurances by the Governor and Democrats in the Legislature, the state budget fails to reject various unfunded mandates, and most notably excludes adequate funding needed to implement the state’s early voting mandate. The New York State Board of Elections estimates that early voting will cost $175 million, a number far greater than the $25 million local governments will receive from the state. This reckless action will put additional pressure on towns, villages, and counties to raise taxes or cut essential services.  “We’re one of the few states experiencing a decrease in population and, in a recent survey, nearly half of our young people said they are on their way out. Our next generation of entrepreneurs, local leaders, and families are set to flee the state and this budget will not change their minds. The budget increases taxes, does nothing to help struggling small businesses, ignores our upstate roads, and slaps more unfunded mandates on local governments. Improving affordability and boosting economic development were my priorities at the start of the budget process and this plan falls flat on both concerns,” said Senate Finance Committee Ranking Republican Senator James L. Seward.  Passed annually, the New York State Budget is supposed to be as much a reflection of policy values as it is about being fiscally responsible with taxpayer money. Because of the new one-party government in New York, other Democrat-driven priorities that made it into the final budget include:  Fully funding an initiative to provide free college tuition for illegal immigrants, while rejecting an increase in Tuition Assistance Program funding that would help middle-class families afford college;  Allowing cashless bail, which will let violent, hardened criminals out onto the streets with no consequence or regard for public safety;  Disproportionately underfunding school aid, with a far greater amount dedicated to New York City schools, effectively shorting aid for every other part of the state; and  Keeping the Hollywood Film Tax Credit, despite Senate Democrats’ previous opposition to corporate incentives, such as for Amazon HQ2.  After being negotiated with little to no transparency for months by leaders of the new one-party government without garnering input from members of the minorities in both houses, passage of the 2019-20 state budget will garner an overwhelming majority of its yes votes from Democrats and New York City-located officials. The budget will create and raises taxes and spending by billions despite previous claims from the Governor’s Budget Director and Comptroller that the state was facing a multi-billion dollar deficit.",partially false

"Democrats have said they only intend to restore the tax rates that existed during the Clinton years. In reality they're proposing rates like those under President Carter. Media reports in recent weeks say that Senate Democrats are considering a 3% surtax on income over $1 million to raise federal revenues. This would come on top of the higher income tax rates that President Obama has already proposed through the cancellation of the Bush era tax-rate reductions. If the Democrats' millionaire surtax were to happen—and were added to other tax increases already enacted last year and other leading tax hike ideas on the table this year—this could leave the U.S. with a combined federal and state top tax rate on earnings of 62%. That's more than double the highest federal marginal rate of 28% when President Reagan left office in 1989. Welcome back to the 1970s. Here's the math behind that depressing calculation. Today's top federal income tax rate is 35%. Almost all Democrats in Washington want to repeal the Bush tax cuts on those who make more than $250,000 and phase out certain deductions, so the effective income tax rate would rise to about 41.5%. The 3% millionaire surtax raises that rate to 44.5%. Then last year, as part of the down payment for ObamaCare, Congress snuck in an extra 0.9% Medicare surtax on ""high-income earners,"" meaning any individual earning more than $200,000 or couples earning more than $250,000. This brings the total tax rate to 47.9%.",partially false
"GEORGIA BECOMES FIRST STATE TO BAN MUSLIM CULTURE IN HISTORIC MOVE TO RESTORE WESTERN VALUES!!! When Donald Trump proposed in 2015 that we place a temporary ban on Muslims entering the United States, it was at a time when Europe was experiencing historical levels of migrations and terrorism. ISIS was carrying out terrorist attacks weekly and hundreds of innocent people were getting killed. Whether it was a jihadi running over 85 people with a truck, the Paris bombings, or even the German priest that was beheaded for being a Christian–they all were fueled by Islam. People need to understand that Islam is very dangerous and contradicts everything we believe in the United States. A Georgia state legislator has introduced legislation that would ban burqas and traditional Muslim veils. State Rep. Jason Spencer (R) filed legislation on Wednesday that would prevent women from posing for driver’s license photos while wearing a veil. The measure also adds burqas to a law that makes it a misdemeanor to wear a face covering in public or while driving. Spencer argues that this bill is specifically intended to reduce fear about Islamic terrorism. Spencer’s bill would prevent women from wearing head coverings while driving or while walking down a public sidewalk. “This bill is simply a response to constituents that do have concerns of the rise of Islamic terrorism, and we in the State of Georgia do not want our laws used against us,” Spencer told WSB-TV in Atlanta. Many people will immediately read this and argue that the First Amendment allows for protection of religious freedoms, and that is a true and correct argument. Our Constitution does allow all citizens to practice whatever religion they choose. Here is the problem: Islam is not a religion. It is a cancerous disease that calls for all Christians, women, and homosexuals to be brutally murdered for the false god Allah. A vast majority of terrorist attacks are carried out in the name of Allah. When was the last time we experienced a terrorist attack from someone citing the Bible? Quran 8:12: I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them. I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them. Quran 9:29: Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Fight against those who believe not in Allah, nor in the Last Day, nor forbid that which has been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger and those who acknowledge not the religion of truth (i.e. Islam) among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians), until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. Quran 3:151: Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority. Is that what we want to blossom in our country, schools, and communities? Just for starters, Liberals already banned school prayer because Christian values may offend someone–so how is this any different? There is a difference between a hijab and burqa. Spencer is arguing that we should ban the full-on cover that cloaks women from head to toe. While Liberals will decry this action, they better accept it because it will have a snowball effect in the United States. Outside of Georgia, several other states are starting to propose similar legislation. The threat of Islam and those that practice it are so severe that France and Belgium have banned burqas and similar coverings altogether to try and keep citizens safe. Local governments in Italy, Spain, and Switzerland have also instituted bans. This move is about keeping the American people safe. Under President Trump, we will do whatever is necessary to keep the American people safe. Source: www.dailyusaupdate.com",FALSE
"Home Alone 2: Lost in New York is full of violence that, in my opinion, exceeds the physical comedy of the original film and is borderline barbarism. The main antagonists were subjected to bricks thrown at them from atop a building, being shot with a staple gun, having their heads lit afire, and being electrocuted. It is actually hard to watch.  But, for CBC TV in Canada, the following scene was too much, and had to be removed from their broadcast of the film:  That’s right, ComicBook.com reports that CBC edited out Donald Trump’s cameo from the 1992 movie. And people watching it were quick to report the suspicious omission on social media. Some were outraged, and the snowflakes were thrilled.

The first time the CBC’s cutting of Trump’s cameo appearance was acknowledged on Twitter was around Christmas that year:  Thanks @CBC for cutting @realDonaldTrump out of Home Alone 2. — Colt McCaullany???? @DENNISGRIMBLE December 22, 2015  Now, either 2015 happened to be the first year the CBC broadcasted the movie, which I highly doubt, or something happened between the 2014 CBC broadcast of Home Alone 2, and the 2015 CBC broadcast. One could argue that Trump wasn’t a political figure in the public’s conscious before 2015, but years prior he had been making headlines for publicly questioning Obama’s birth certificate—so I don’t think that excuse really works. Had his cameo been cut before then, I’m sure it would have been noticed.  Trump’s presidential bid appears to be the beginning of the folks at the CBC being triggered by Trump so badly that they actually had to edit him out of their broadcast of the film. I can’t decide if this is hilarious or sad.  Update January 2: Just to be clear, the CBC issued a formal statement saying Home Alone 2 was edited in 2014 when they first obtained the rights to the movie.  _____  Matt Margolis is the author of Trumping Obama: How President Trump Saved Us From Barack Obama’s Legacy and the bestselling book The Worst President in History: The Legacy of Barack Obama.

"Burning the flag of the USA is protected free speech. It’s legal. The issue has been heard by the Supreme Court of the United States and has been settled. That’s it. We have to accept it, no matter how distasteful.  President Trump has also made his peace with this even though he hates it with every fiber of his being. But Trump is a thinker. He’s shrewd and he fights for what’s right by taking the winded road if a straight line is not available. And he’s come through again with yet another piece of brilliant, innovative thinking. This is why we elected him.  President Trump has now signed Executive Order Number 3275 and put its contents into law. It states:  “The destruction or desecration of the flag of the United States of America, in any way shape or form, whether through burning, cutting, shredding, or any other means the court may deem fitting, will hereafter be classified as a hate crime, punishable under the American Hate Crimes statute, with identical sentencing guidelines.”  Criminal behavior charged as a hate crime carries a much stricter punishment than those without the classification. Flag burners may now face up to 50 years in prison upon conviction.  This Presidential Order is an effective workaround of the Supreme Court’s decision regarding free speech. While Trump was not able to reject the court’s previous ruling, he was legally able to make this new designation. Haters of this country beware. Your time is up.",FALSE

"(CNN) From the moment a child is born, its gender pretty much determines how they will dress, which toys they'll be given and ultimately how they are meant to behave within society. But some schools in Sweden are trying to strip away such gender norms. There's nothing obviously out of the ordinary at Sweden's gender-neutral preschools at first glance. There are no designated areas to play with dolls or building blocks. The toys have been strategically jumbled to create an environment for girls and boys to play together. These two preschools in Sweden -- Nicolaigarden and Egalia (meaning 'equality' in Latin) -- go to great lengths to de-emphasize gender. Children are given the freedom to challenge and cross gender boundaries. Rather than encourage children to do particular things, the teachers are careful not to box children based on their gender or subtly discourage them from doing certain things. The school has removed the terms ""girl"" and ""boy"" completely. Instead they make a deliberate effort to call each child by their first name or the gender-neutral pronoun ""hen"". But is it necessary to intervene at such a young age, and what are the long-term effects? Children play in the garden of Egalia. Removing the 'gender straitjacket' A new global study found that young girls and boys are outfitted with ""gender straitjackets"" by the age of 10 , resulting in lifelong negative consequences. The Global Early Adolescent Study analyzed how gender is learned, enforced and reinforced among early adolescents in 15 countries. It concluded that culturally-enforced gender stereotypes -- which are linked to an increased risk of mental and physical health problems -- are firmly rooted between the ages of 10 and 14. The study found these stereotypes leave girls at greater risk of exposure to physical and sexual violence, child marriage, and HIV. For boys, the risks can include substance abuse and suicide. In Sweden, which is ranked as the fourth-most equal country in the world when it comes to gender, the government has made a concerted effort to emphasize equality in the Education Act. Following a new amendment introduced in 1998 requiring all schools to work against gender stereotyping, Lotta Rajalin set up her first gender-neutral preschool for one to five-year-olds in Stockholm's Old Town. The gender-neutral policies at Rajalin's schools ensure that stories, songs and dramatizations are screened or re-scripted to include non-nuclear families (single parents or same-sex couples) and heroines sweeping princes off their feet. Teachers opt for non-traditional plot twists to ensure that they're not reinforcing gender stereotypes.

Destinations for the 2018-19 school year include India, Botswana, Japan and Spain. Hide Caption 10 of 10 How to be a gender-neutral teacher Perhaps the most important distinction in these preschools is the way the teachers treat each child. To help identify any unconscious bias they have when dealing with girls and boys, the teachers filmed themselves interacting with children and took note of how they responded to the different sexes. ""After we had been filming and observing each other, we understood that it's not the children we have to change, it's ourselves,"" Rajalin tells CNN. Lotta Rajalin, director at Nicolaigarden and Egalia gender-neutral preschools. They discovered they used different tones of voice when talking to girls or boys, and tolerated rowdiness in boys while discouraging it in girls. Similarly, they found themselves to be more likely to comfort a crying girl, while they would tell a crying boy to brush it off. ""When you change yourself and your thinking and your expectations, you will see new things and you will see that it's better for children's development,"" she says. Rajalin believes gender stereotypes limit the opportunities available to a child. Her gender-neutral teaching methods stem from what she calls ""the whole life spectra"" or ""circle of opportunity."" This circle is often divided into two semi-circles -- one for boys and one for girls. Through gender-neutral teaching, Rajalin hopes to open up this circle of opportunities for all children to define themselves. ""We try to take away the barriers which stop both girls and boys doing what they want to do,"" she says. ""We want all children to have the same opportunities to feel, to express themselves, to like what color they like, to play the sport they're in, and so on. We don't want to limit them."" Following a small, structured observation of children at one of Rajalin's preschools, Ben Kenward, a researcher in psychology at Uppsala University in Sweden and Oxford Brookes University in England, found these children had a reduced tendency to be influenced by gender stereotypes, compared to a control group of children from a typical Swedish preschool. ""The [gender neutral] pedagogy is having some of the effects that it's intended to have, and if you're committed to giving these young children the same opportunities ... then our study suggests that this kind of pedagogy is a good tool."" 'Brainwashing children' However, these gender-neutral policies have generated much criticism over the years. Swedish psychiatrist and author David Eberhard considers calling boys and girls ""hen"" to be ""intellectually dishonest"" as it is being ""blind to biological differences."" ""This is the kind of brainwash that works when the kids are small and in the short run they adapt to this, but what happens when they go to normal school and they find out they were living in a sect?"" he tells CNN. ""This is a sort of a religious sect to say there's no differences between men and women, it has nothing to do with science."" Eberhard explained that he does not oppose boys choosing to play with dolls, but he draws the line at calling a girl or boy ""it"" or ""hen"". Rajalin believes a lot of criticism is misguided, as people do not fully understand what they are trying to do. ""We are not trying to say girls should be boys or boys should be girls, we just want every person to have the right to be the person they are, regardless of gender,"" she says. Rajalin says her gender-neutral preschools give children the same opportunities, obligations and rights, regardless of gender. Harmless 'experiment' While Eberhard's views are strong, he says gender-neutral schooling is unlikely to have any negative long-term effects on young children. ""I suppose that they [the children] are so sure about their identity that it doesn't matter,"" he says. ""But, as individuals, you may very well have young kids of different sexes that become very frustrated or confused."" He believes Sweden would be better off solving the problem of gender inequality in the real world. Rajalin, however, believes adopting gender-neutral methods and exposing children to teachers of various different ethnicities, religions, sexes and sexual orientations, will better prepare them for the nuances of the real world. It will boost their self-confidence and set them up to be more successful in life, she says. Psychology professor Philip Hwang from the University of Gothenburg is not convinced. He thinks Rajalin's gender-neutral preschools are harmless but overrated. ""I don't really see any harm in it, but I think it pleases the parents more than it changes the children,"" he tells CNN. He says he has met a couple of parents that really believe sending their children to gender-neutral preschool will have lasting effects and that they will grow up in a gender-neutral society. ""It's a statement more than something that has actual effect on children's long-term development with regard to gender issues,"" he says. ""It takes generations to change norms and values like this."" Even Kenward, who is optimistic that the gender-neutral pedagogy is creating equal opportunities for children of both genders, is unsure what the long-term effects will be. ""It's an open question what happens to these children when they move into primary school,"" he says. ""My guess is it [gender neutral pedagogy] could continue to influence their behavior potentially, not in a very strong way necessarily. But it may have some lasting effects.""",TRUE

"When Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before a Senate Judiciary Committee and Commerce Committee joint hearing Tuesday, I asked a relatively simple question: does Facebook consider itself a neutral public forum?  Zuckerberg said that Facebook is a “platform for all ideas,” but declined to give a “yes” or “no” answer. The problem is, this is not merely an academic distinction between words. Facebook’s answer to the question could affect millions of users, and attract or prevent a lot of attention from federal regulators.  Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act CDA states: No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.  This is a good provision. It means that, for example, if you run a blogging platform and someone posts a terrorist threat in the comments section, you’re not treated as the person making the threat. Without Section 230, many social media networks could be functionally unable to operate.  In order to be protected by Section 230, companies like Facebook should be “neutral public forums.” On the flip side, they should be considered to be a “publisher or speaker” of user content if they pick and choose what gets published or spoken.  As I expressed to Mark Zuckerberg, as a private business Facebook has a clear First Amendment right to publish whatever it wants on its website within the bounds of the law. The company can support political causes and oppose ones it disagrees with, just like a private citizen can speak his or her mind or agitate against opposing views.  But if Facebook is busy censoring legal, protected speech for political reasons, the company should be held accountable for the posts it lets through. And it should not enjoy any special congressional immunity from liability for its actions.  As we discussed at the Senate hearing, for years it has been evident that Facebook has actively censored or suppressed conservative speech.  In May 2016, Gizmodo reported that Facebook had purposely and routinely suppressed conservative stories from trending news, including stories about the Conservative Political Action Conference CPAC, Mitt Romney and Obama administration scandals.  Facebook’s actions have ranged from seemingly petty things – like shutting down a “Chick-Fil-A Appreciation Day” to blocking posts from journalists, specific religious groups and most recently, grassroots Trump supporters Diamond and Silk.  Facebook’s explanation for limiting access to a popular page with 1.3 million Facebook followers was that it was “unsafe to the community.” Many Americans see this as just the latest poor excuse in a pervasive pattern of political bias.  While such stories abound, it is virtually unheard of to see any ads or pages from liberal groups like Planned Parenthood, Moveon.org, or Democratic candidates being targeted for removal.  Whether you call it targeting, censorship, or shadow-banning, these are not the actions of a “neutral public forum.”  Zuckerberg told the Senate hearing that his goal is “not to engage in political speech.” But if a company allows a politically biased corporate culture to persist – and deliberately avoids diversity of thought in its hires – its actions can very quickly escalate into the political realm and endanger its status as a true “platform for all ideas.”  According to Zuckerberg, Facebook employs over 15,000 people in security and content review. If all or virtually all are left-wing Democrats – and if they are empowered to secretly silence the voices of all with whom they disagree – that poses profound threats to our democratic discourse.  Newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst, at the height of yellow journalism, never possessed such unchecked power over free speech.  Zuckerberg proved a good sport for responding to reams of questions from 43 senators for five hours. I commend him for admitting that Silicon Valley “is an extremely left-leaning place” and committing to “making sure that we don’t have any bias in the work that we do.”  It is critical that Facebook and other tech platforms take these realizations to heart, because surrendering their status as neutral public forum – engaging in discrimination of political viewpoints – invites government oversight and regulation of social media. This is something that nobody wants and it invites revoking the company’s immunity from liability.  The free exchange of ideas and information on the Internet over the last 25 years has produced a cultural, technological and educational revolution to rival the Wright brothers or nuclear energy. Our largest forums for that continuing exchange should do all they can to keep it a free one, unburdened by censorship or government intrusion.",partially false

"Working with the Keystone State's conservatives in Congress, President Trump has signed more laws rolling back federal red tape than any president in American history. Our administration has eliminated 22 federal regulations for every new rule put on the books. Vice President Mike Pence addresses the crowd at the America First Policies event in Rosemont, Ill.Charles Rex Arbogast / AP Photographer, File by Mike Pence, For the Inquirer
Published Jul 22, 2018 When I visit Philadelphia on Monday, I will deliver an important message to the hardworking men and women of the Keystone State: Our agenda is delivering real results – and we're just getting started. Simply look at the historic tax cuts that President Trump signed last December. With the strong support of every Pennsylvania Republican in Congress, we enacted the largest tax cuts and reform in American history.
Under our tax cuts, the first $24,000 of income for a married couple is now 100 percent income-tax free, nearly double what it was before. We also increased the child tax credit from $1,000 to $2,000. And we cut out the core of ObamaCare by eliminating the individual mandate tax, so Pennsylvanians will no longer be forced to buy government-mandated health insurance you don't want and can't afford. All told, the typical family of four in the Philadelphia area will save nearly $2,500 on their taxes every single year. This is a win for working families. It means a down payment on a car, a new refrigerator, or saving a little bit more for your kids' education. We also cut taxes on job creators of all sizes. Businesses across the Keystone State and around the nation have already responded with renewed investment in their workers. Nationwide, more than 6 million Americans — including at least 73,000 Pennsylvanians – have received bigger pay raises, better benefits, and cash bonuses because of our tax cuts.
But this is just the beginning. As businesses continue to invest their tax-cut savings in their workers, we estimate that annual wages for Pennsylvania families will rise by more than $4,200 in the years ahead. The Keystone State is represented by strong Republican leaders in our nation's capital who helped pass our tax cuts, including Congressman Lou Barletta. Rep. Barletta and his Republican colleagues stood with President Trump to put more money in the pockets of working families and job creators, and they deserve Pennsylvania's thanks. The same can't be said of Sen. Bob Casey. Sen. Casey voted against cutting your taxes – and time and again, he votes against the policies that Pennsylvania's working families need.
The evidence is clear: Our tax cuts are working for Pennsylvania, and so is the rest of our agenda. Working with the Keystone State's conservatives in Congress, President Trump has signed more laws rolling back federal red tape than any president in American history. Our administration has eliminated 22 federal regulations for every new rule put on the books. We've also unleashed affordable American energy to power our factories, farms, and homes. We're standing up to predatory trade practices from countries, such as China, and we're fighting tirelessly to break down trade barriers, so Pennsylvania farmers and manufacturers have new opportunities to expand and export and create more jobs right here in Philadelphia.
The results have been extraordinary. Since the Keystone State voted to send President Trump to the White House, America's job creators have added nearly 3.7 million new jobs. More than 115,000 have been created in Pennsylvania alone –including more than 10,000 manufacturing jobs. And the unemployment rate in the Philadelphia metro area is now at its lowest level ever recorded. But for all we've done, there's still more work to do. The good people of Pennsylvania can be assured that we will continue to keep our promises to you. President Trump made that clear once again when he nominated Judge Brett Kavanaugh to be the next justice on the Supreme Court. Like all the principled jurists who we've put on the federal courts, Judge Kavanaugh will uphold all the God-given liberties enshrined in the Constitution of the United States. Under President Trump, the forgotten men and women of America are forgotten no more. In the days ahead, with the continued support of the hardworking men and women of Pennsylvania, we'll finish what we've started, and we will Make America Great Again.

"Content_Area1  A Letter from Governor Tony Evers    I've been an educator my entire adult life.    Some of the most meaningful moments in my life happened in the classroom. I met my wife, Kathy, in Mrs. Potter's kindergarten class in my hometown of Plymouth, Wisconsin. My first job was teaching science in Baraboo. Before becoming state superintendent, I was a high school principal in Tomah, and I ran school districts in Oakfield and Verona. As state superintendent, I worked to ensure every child in Wisconsin can get a world class education by creating a public school system that is fair for all.    I'm not only an educator – I'm also a parent. My three kids attended public schools in communities around the state. No matter where the Evers family ended up, we were welcomed by the community. That culture of acceptance is part of what makes Wisconsin special.    I believe that we are stronger when we look out for each other. I was elected governor and as state superintendent three times by a coalition of Democrats, Independents, and Republicans because I'm honest, I work hard, and I know how to treat folks on the other side of the aisle with respect without sacrificing our Wisconsin values.    I've worked across party lines to get things done for our kids, and now as governor, I am working to build an economy that works for everyone, healthier communities, support for our kids and our schools, and better roads and infrastructure. I believe? that every single person in our state deserves an equal opportunity to get ahead and that we must work together to change the direction of our state for the better.

"The growing stream of reporting on and data about fake news, misinformation, partisan content, and news literacy is hard to keep up with. This weekly roundup offers the highlights of what you might have missed. Who shares the most “junk news”? (But “junk news” ≠ fake news.) Trump supporters and the far right: That’s according to a report out this week from the Computational Propaganda Project at the University of Oxford. But be careful of definitions here! Over three months leading up to Trump’s State of the Union Address this past January, Oxford researchers looked at “the distribution of posts and comments on public pages that contain links to junk news sources, across the political spectrum in the U.S. We then map the influence of central sources of junk political news and information that regularly publish content on hot-button issues in the U.S.” Note the use of the term “junk news.” The paper’s definition of it includes a wide variety of sites and sources — yes, many what would broadly be considered “fake news,” but also partisan sites, especially conservative ones like Breitbart, the Drudge Report, the Daily Caller, and NewsMax (plus liberal ones like Crooks and Liars and Occupy Democrats). And it also includes some real headscratchers: the National Review, the New York Daily News, Mediaite, the polling site Rasmussen Reports, and the conservative nonprofit Judicial Watch. You may disagree with some or all of those sites from day to day, but it’s an odd choice to lump them all together with “‘Spirit cooking’: Clinton campaign chairman practices bizarre occult ritual” and “Breaking: FBI confirms evidence of huge underground Clinton sex network,” as the paper does. (“Junk news” publishers “deliberately publish misleading, deceptive or incorrect information purporting to be real news about politics, economics or culture,” according to the authors. “This content includes various forms of propaganda and ideologically extreme, hyper-partisan, or conspiratorial news and information.” The paper outlines a multilayered test to determine a publisher’s junkiness; among the criteria are “emotionally driven language with emotive expressions,” “misleading headlines,” and “excessive capitalization.”) Looking at nearly 48,000 public Facebook pages and tweets from 14,000 users, the researchers found that a network of Trump supporters on Twitter “shares the widest range of known junk news sources and circulates more junk news than all the other groups together,” while on Facebook, far-right pages shared and circulated it the most.

It’s stuff you might call commentary masking as news, if you were being generous.” (Again with the capitalization!) What it’s not is straight “fake news” — no matter how you see it covered by outlets like The Guardian (“Fake news sharing in US is a rightwing thing, says study”), Mother Jones (“Trump Supporters Spread the Majority of Phony News on Social Media”), or Newsweek (“LIBERALS DON’T SHARE OR BELIEVE FAKE NEWS AS MUCH AS RIGHT-WINGERS, STUDY FINDS”). Misleading headlines and excessive capitalization — don’t let Oxford catch you, Newsweek! The Washington Post’s Erik Wemple writes: Banging out a news taxonomy is a towering challenge. There’s just way too much news, way too many sources, and way too many tweets and Facebook postings out there. Given that ocean, the Oxford folks devised a sensible plan: Reach judgments about news sources, and then examine how stories from those sources get passed around. Yet the apparent overclassification of some right-wing sites raises the possibility that the study, at least in part, merely caught conservatives sharing conservative journalism. Facebook met with its fact-checking partners. “My general takeaway is that Facebook is stepping up its commitment to this partnership by investing a lot more internal resources in the third-party fact-checking product,” writes Poynter/ICFN’s Alexios Mantzarlis, who was at the meeting.

"A worker with the Detroit Department of Elections carries empty boxes used to organize absentee ballots after nearing the end of the absentee ballot count at the Central Counting Board in the TCF Center in Detroit, Mich., on Nov. 4, 2020. Elaine Cromie/Getty Images  More Than 10,000 Dead People Cast Ballots in Michigan, Analysis Shows  More than 10,000 people confirmed or suspected dead have returned their mail-in ballots to vote in Michigan, according to an analysis of the state’s election data.  About 9,500 voters confirmed dead through the Social Security Death Index SSDI are marked in the state’s mail voting database as having returned ballots. Another nearly 2,000 are 100 years old or more and aren’t listed as known living centenarians.  The analysis was provided by Richard Baris, director of Big Data Poll.  The data indicates that somebody else was trying to vote on behalf of these people.  “It’s also entirely possible that some of them aren’t even real people,” Baris told The Epoch Times via email. “If someone is 110 or some ridiculous age, we should have their death record but do not.”  Americans older than 110 are exceedingly rare; only a handful of such seniors are known to live in Michigan.  According to the 2010 Census, there were 1,729 centenarians in Michigan pdf.  Even if somebody tried to vote on behalf of a deceased person, the vote would be rejected, according to Tracy Wimmer, spokeswoman for the Michigan secretary of state.  “Ballots of voters who have died are rejected in Michigan, even if the voter cast an absentee ballot and then died before Election Day,” she previously told The Epoch Times via email.  However, Baris isn’t convinced.  “While I’m open to the idea some of these have been rejected, I’m not open to any outright dismissal they all were rejected,” he said in a Nov. 8 tweet.  The data on how many ballots were rejected isn’t available yet, Wimmer said.  She said that “a ballot received for a living voter may be recorded in a way that makes it appear as if the voter is dead.”  “This can be because of voters with similar names, where the ballot is accidentally recorded as voted by John Smith Sr., when it was actually voted by John Smith Jr., or because of inaccurately recorded birth dates in the qualified voter file.”  This only happens “on rare occasions,” she said.  Democratic nominee Joe Biden leads in Michigan by less than 150,000 votes. The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit in Michigan to halt vote counting until Republican observers are granted adequate access. The GOP-led Michigan legislature is investigating allegations of election irregularities in the state.  In a Nov. 9 lawsuit, a Detroit poll watcher alleged thousands of mail-in ballots from people who weren’t properly registered to vote were added to vote counts.  Poll operators were adding names and addresses to the poll book with made-up birth dates, such as 1/1/1900, he said in a sworn affidavit.  Baris said the mail voting data he worked from likely isn’t up to date enough to capture any irregularities that happened Election Day and after.  “If they did that on Election Day in Michigan, then we likely wouldn’t know until December,” he said. “If it is true, then they’d, unfortunately, get away with it in the short-term.”  President Donald Trump is challenging the results of the elections in several states where Biden holds a tight lead. The Trump campaign is alleging invalid ballots were counted for Democrats, valid ballots were thrown away for Republicans, and Republican ballot watchers were prevented from meaningfully observing the vote-counting process.",FALSE

The Guayaquil Family Network and other pro-life organizations recently began a petition urging President Lenin Moreno to reject the abortion agenda within the aid, according to the report. “It goes against the Constitution, specifically article 45, which guarantees the right to life from conception, a right that was ratified last September 17 at the plenary session of the National Assembly,” Villafuerte said. HELP LIFENEWS SAVE BABIES FROM ABORTION! Please help LifeNews.com with a donation! Villafuerte said the UN plan would give Ecuador $46.4 million, but $3 million of that aid would be used to train “health personnel on safe, legal abortion and post-abortion care.” Some lawmakers are speaking out against the abortion agenda, too. “Unbelievable! The UN conditions ‘safe legal abortion’ in its humanitarian support plan for Ecuador,” Assemblyman Héctor Yépez wrote on Twitter. “While we all want to save lives, some insist on eliminating the lives of unborn girls and boys.” UPDATE 5/26/20: The Ecuadorian government has assured Yépez that funds would not be used to legalize abortions and would only be spent in accordance with current laws. In statements to ACI Prensa, legislator Yépez referred to the Foreign Ministry’s response. “The objective of preventing them from executing what the UN wanted, which was an attempt to advance abortion, was achieved, but now they come out with a pun to wash their faces, in which they say that they were only referring to what it was already established in the Comprehensive Organic Penal Code ”. “I think the objective has been met, having discovered the intent, and with this letter they themselves are ensuring that they are not going to execute anything outside of what the law says in Ecuador, which is what we were looking for,” he stressed. However, Yépez urged “to remain very vigilant so that the COVID-19 Humanitarian Response Plan is not distorted.” The United Nations has faced prior international criticism for pushing abortions as part of its response to the coronavirus. Jonathan Abbamonte of the Population Research Institute wrote more about it earlier this month: The United Nations Population Fund UNFPA has also been urging governments to ensure uninterrupted access to abortion during the pandemic. An interim technical brief recently issued by UNFPA calls on governments to: “Ensure women’s and girls’ choices and rights to sexual and reproductive health is respected regardless of their COVID-19 status, including access to contraception, emergency contraception, safe abortion to the full extent of the law.” The technical brief also advises governments to “encourage” women who have recovered from a COVID-19 infection to seek abortion services “to the full extent of the law.” This seems a backhanded way of saying that, when women come to African health clinics to be treated for the coronavirus, they should also be propagandized about the benefits of abortion. Health care in Africa has often been directly tied to population control programs in this way. The WHO also faced heavy criticism from pro-life leaders this spring when it falsely claimed abortion is an essential service during the coronavirus pandemic. President Donald Trump stopped giving United States tax dollars to the United Nations Population Fund in 2017, and, in April, he halted funding to the World Health Organization WHO.

"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative CHAI distributed “watered-down” HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and “likely increased” the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.  The congressional report, titled,“The Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,” was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation’s most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.  The congressional report focused on Clinton’s decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.  It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower, permitting the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.  Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.  [dcquiz] The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.  “This is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation’s largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,” said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.  “When companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA’s approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,” said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.  The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, “alleged due to the company’s diluted drugs, it ‘subjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,’” according to the report.  “The question becomes, ‘how many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,’” asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.  The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign.  Blackburn said she planned to deliver the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama’s first term.  The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration FDA and the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation’s vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.  It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the “watered-down” drugs.  ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered “more than $1.8 million packages.”  “Substandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,” Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.  Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company’s anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.  “These drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,” he said.  Ranbaxy’s first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.  The FDA sent a public “warning letter” to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company’s quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, “show much lower potencies in these batches.”  Although Ranbaxy’s generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company’s HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.  Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.  Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.  Thakur said he’s now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on “access” to patients.  The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. “I have tried to reach out to them,” he told TheDCNF. “But I haven’t had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.”  CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.  Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was “deeply suspect.”  “In the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‘CHAI’ was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,” Ortel told TheDCNF.  The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.  He signed an executive order that, “relaxed intellectual property policy standards,” promising the U.S. government “would not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‘Sub-Saharan country’ relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,” the report states.  CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.  CHAI’s endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS relief — a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.  The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton’s endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become “good acquisition targets,” according to the study.  Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.  The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they “exploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,” the report states.  The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.  One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.  Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.  Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.  Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the “false hopes” offered by the Clinton Foundation.  “You think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it’s disturbing and very sad,” she said.

"Scott Walker celebrates with supporters. (Darren Hauck/Getty) Why it was the most important GOP victory in the country The most important election in the country yesterday was the gubernatorial race in Wisconsin. In its historic implications, Scott Walker’s victory was on a par with the GOP’s winning control of the Senate, arguably as important as all the other gubernatorial and congressional elections put together. And the reasons have nothing to do with his presidential prospects. Walker has now proven that his reforms in Wisconsin are both a model for conservative reform and a winning electoral strategy. But those reforms still have a long way to go. The crucial question was whether Wisconsin’s voters were going to give him the chance to keep pushing. Advertisement Walker came to office inspired by the advice of Governor Mitch Daniels of Indiana, who told him to think bold and strike fast. The spearhead of Walker’s reform agenda was Act 10, which broke the stranglehold of public-sector unions on Wisconsin’s deplorable finances. Act 10 essentially turned Wisconsin, one of the leading lights of the labor-union movement, into a right-to-work state. (Wisconsin is still technically a union state with respect to the National Labor Relations Act, but private-sector unions in Wisconsin have waned to the point of irrelevance, so the major union presence was in the public sector.) The challenge Walker faced was that reforms take time to work, and – initially, at least — generate much more opposition than support. His approval ratings in Wisconsin plunged to 37 percent as the venomous reaction of entrenched special interests (in this case, public-sector unions) took its toll. Those special interests enjoyed enormous political support both in Wisconsin and across the country, and Walker had only four years to demonstrate that the benefits of conservative reform could outweigh that support among moderates and independents. Advertisement Progressives correctly identified the threat that Walker represents to them nationally. If the most sacred privileges of their special interests could be undone in the birthplace of progressivism, those perks wouldn’t be safe anywhere in the country. But if Walker had lost, it would have meant that sweeping conservative reforms of government would face uncertain prospects in virtually every state and at the national level. Governor Mitch Daniels succeeded in reforming Indiana, but he was in many ways sui generis. Now, however, what Daniels did in Indiana has been replicated in Wisconsin. The birthplace of progressivism, the Midwestern heartland, is becoming the birthplace of a new conservatism — a conservatism not just of limited government but of good government; not just pro-business but pro-competition, a conservatism bent on defending the common man from the rapacious rule of special interests. It’s a conservatism that can be true to its principles and still appeal to moderates, independents, and even Democrats. Indeed, a large number of Wisconsin voters have voted twice for Obama and twice for Walker. Walker was undoubtedly helped in this race by the neighboring example of Illinois, where Governor Pat Quinn has been busy demonstrating in Technicolor the flaws of progressive government. The Left explains Walker’s victory in terms of outside forces (read: Koch brothers) who influenced the election with their money. But no combination of cabals and conspiracies and evil corporations could have come close to helping Walker as much as the Democratic government of Illinois. There’s an even more important reason that Walker’s victory matters. A century of progressivism has left Wisconsin in a very deep hole. When Walker got to office, Wisconsin was one of the worst states in the country in which to do business, with one of the highest regulatory and tax burdens. Some estimates now rate it as No. 14 for doing business, but don’t be deceived. Wisconsin’s state budget is almost twice as large per person as the state budget of Texas, and even after billions in tax cuts, Wisconsin’s working families and businesses remain subject to a heavy tax burden. Freed from the shackles of heavy government, Wisconsin’s superbly productive labor force could transform it into one of the country’s leading economies — a “Texas model” for purple states. Advertisement Walker has a long way to go in proving that conservative reforms can work in the long term. For the moment, Wisconsin’s conservatives, moderates, and independents have decided to give him another term. Here’s hoping he doesn’t rest on his laurels, and instead once again thinks bold and strikes fast, as he did four years ago. — Mario Loyola, a contributing editor at National Review, is a graduate of the University of Wisconsin in Madison.",partially false

"Global Hot Air: Here's a United Nations climate report that environmentalists probably don't want anybody to read. It says that even if every country abides by the grand promises they made last year in Paris to reduce greenhouse gases, the planet would still be ""doomed."" X When President Obama hitched America to the Paris accords in 2016, he declared that it was ""the moment that we finally decided to save our planet."" And when Trump pulled out of the deal this year, he was berated by legions of environmentalists for killing it. But it turns out that the Paris accord was little more than a sham that will do nothing to ""save the planet."" According to the latest annual UN report on the ""emissions gap,"" the Paris agreement will provide only a third of the cuts in greenhouse gas that environmentalists claim is needed to prevent catastrophic warming. If every country involved in those accords abides by their pledges between now and 2030 — which is a dubious proposition — temperatures will still rise by 3 degrees Celsius by 2100. The goal of the Paris agreement was to keep the global temperature increase to under 2 degrees. Eric Solheim, head of the U.N. Environment Program, which produces the annual report, said this week that ""One year after the Paris Agreement entered into force, we still find ourselves in a situation where we are not doing nearly enough to save hundreds of millions of people from a miserable future. Governments, the private sector and civil society must bridge this catastrophic climate gap."" The report says unless global greenhouse gas emissions peak before 2020, the CO2 levels will be way above the goal set for 2030, which, it goes on, will make it ""extremely unlikely that the goal of holding global warming to well below 2 degrees C can still be reached."" Not to worry. The UN claims that closing this gap will be easy enough, if nations set their collective minds to it. But this is a fantasy. The list of what would need to be done by 2020 — a little over two years from now — includes: Boosting renewable energy's share to 30%. Pushing electric cars to 15% of new car sales, up from less than 1% today. Doubling mass transit use. Cutting air travel CO2 emissions by 20%. And coming up with $1 trillion for ""climate action."" Oh, and coal-fired power plants would have to be phased out worldwide, starting now. According to the report, ""phasing out coal consumption … is an indispensable condition for achieving international climate change targets."" That means putting a halt to any new coal plants while starting to phase out the ones currently in use. Good luck with that. There are currently 273 gigawatts of coal capacity under construction around the world, and another 570 gigawatts in the pipeline, the UN says. That would represent a 42% increase in global energy production from coal. Does anyone really think developing countries who need coal as a cheap source of fuel to grow their economies will suddenly call it quits? So, does this mean the planet is doomed? Hardly. As we have noted in this space many times, all those forecasts of global catastrophe are based on computer models that have been unreliable predictors of warming. And all of the horror stories assume the worst. What the report does make clear, however, is that all the posturing by government leaders in Paris was just that. Posturing. None of these countries intended to take the drastic and economically catastrophic steps environmentalist claim are needed to prevent a climate change doomsday. As such, Trump was right to stop pretending. Whether you believe in climate change or not, the Paris climate accord amounted to nothing, or pretty close to it. Even the UN admits that now.

"I hate science, evidently, because I’m woke to the manifest truth about what the leftist elite currently calls “climate change."" It is the second most staggering fraud ever perpetrated upon the American people after the media’s promotion of the unstoppable candidacy of Beto (who is a furry). Like some suckers still do, I once believed that “science” was a rigorous process where you tested theories and revised those theories in response to objective evidence. But in today’s shabby practice, “science” is just a package of self-serving lies buttressing the transnational liberal elite’s preferred narrative. Our alleged betters hope that labeling their propaganda “science” will science-shame you into silence about what everyone knows is a scam. Nah. “Climate change” is a hoax. Come arrest me for felony denial. Understand that the term “climate change” does not refer to actual meteorological phenomena but, rather, to the sordid rat-king of lies, scams and power grabs that we are commanded to accept as pagan gospel lest we burn to a crisp or drown or suffer...whatever the Armageddon du jour is. When you say “climate change is a grift,” and you should as often as possible, you are pointing out that this green-on-the-outside/red-on-the-inside fake frenzy is really just a set of intertwined grifts transparently designed to separate you from your freedom and your property in the name of somehow adjusting the weather. Observing that “climate change” is steaming garbage served in a dirty ashtray is not disputing that the climate changes. That the climate is not static, and never could be static, is one of the myriad reasons that this whole idea is ridiculous. The planet gets hotter, it gets colder, sometimes quickly, sometimes over eons, and there are a bunch of reasons why, like the sun and volcanos. Human-produced carbon might be one of the factors, but there’s simply no evidence that it is a significant one. Of course, if they really cared about carbon, they would be up in arms about China and India, which are upping their output while we are slashing ours. Yet the object of their ire is your New York strip. Gosh, does that seem consistent with 1) someone truly concerned about atmospheric carbon, or 2) someone who trembles with joy at the notion of bossing around you rubes out in gun/Jesusland? The underlying premise of their claims seems to be that there is a “right” temperature for the earth; watch them sputter when you enquire about that perfect setting for Earth’s thermostat. Remember, if you ask questions you hate “science.” If they did stop telling you how you hate “science” long enough to respond, they might explain that of course there’s no perfect temperature – it’s not like LA, where it’s always 72 degrees. But then, what are they comparing the present climate to in order to declare that our climate is “getting worse?” If you establish a climate baseline, then you can compare what’s actually happening to the baseline and that might demonstrate that the whole thing is baloney. That would be awkward. It happened after Katrina. Oh, Katrina’s proof positive that Gaia is really ticked off and…and…and…then we had a bunch of years without much hurricane action at all. You might think that this would be evidence that maybe the climate wasn’t in chaos, and that they would be happy to be proven wrong, but no, it doesn’t work that way. Every time the weather fits the narrative, you see, it’s proof that the climate kooks are right, and every time the weather fails to fit the narrative, well, weather’s not climate. At least until the next heat wave or storm; then weather will totally be climate again. Heads, you must give us all your freedom and money, and also tails, you must give us all your freedom and money. Now, we’re being told that we’re all going to die in…I guess we’re down to what? About 11.5 years this go ‘round? Of course, we’ve been told many times that we’re doomed and the deadlines have come and gone with the doomsdayers not missing a beat. They’re like old timey Elmer Gantrys promising the apocalypse over and over again, with their hardcore true believers regularly showing up for the rapture over and over again no matter how many times the Four Horseman fail to turn up. We haven’t even seen one horseman. Back in the 70s, I remember we were promised an ice age if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom. Then in the 80s, we were promised death by ozone hole if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom, and then doom by acid rain if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom. By the time they started promising that we were all gonna die from global warming if we didn’t give liberals our money and freedom, I was still wanting my ice age. It would be nice to have a white Christmas in LA. So, where’s my damn ice age? Oh right, only a climate denier – Climate, I deny thee! – might wonder why we should hand over one, ten, a hundred trillion bucks to people who have never once been right about their predictions. You evidently hate “science” if you expect the “science” people to be correct at least one time in a half-century. And they’re not even good at short-term prognostication. Heck, for several days Hurricane Dorian was supposed to slam head on into Florida and then…it didn’t. The Obamas just bought a $15 million pad on the beach – what’s that say about their faith in “science?” But don’t worry, the guys batting .000 so far will definitely get the temperature in 2119 right if we only just write them a huge check and transform ourselves from citizens to serfs. That’s another big red flag – have you noticed how “science” always tells us that the only possible response to the climate hullabaloo is to give liberals exactly what they always wanted anyway? How lucky are the leftists to have had an existential problem drop in their laps where the only solution is to give them everything they could not otherwise convince us to give them? What a remarkable coincidence! And what’s also weird is how nothing that we must do right now no time to debate it’s a crisis think o’ the children in any way inconveniences or calls for sacrifices from our climate crisis-pushing elite. Boy, they really scored with climate change – if they were going to manufacture a crisis in order to get the power and money they craved, how would they do it any differently? Now, they might claim that they too will have to sacrifice to the Angry Weather Demon, but it’s unclear how. I suppose they might stop flying across the globe to climate finger-wagging festivals in private jets, but call me jaded for thinking that if it’s such a crisis today and they have not stopped doing it yet, they won’t stop jetting about down the road. Oh, but you will. You most definitely will stop flying and driving the vehicles you choose and eating cheeseburgers and using straws that don’t disintegrate into gummy sludge in your Dr. Pepper. But them? Pete Buttigieg explained away his zipping around in Gulfstreams as necessary because it is important for him to be pestering people in Des Moines. Bet you that pretty much everything our betters want to do will turn out to be “important.” And I’ll bet that nothing what you peasants want to do will. One might think that if stopping carbon was important, you might want to explore nuclear power. But you would think wrong. After all, if there’s plenty of electrical power, the elite loses the political power that comes from divvying up a scarce resource. If they control the power, they control you. Cheap, plentiful power makes you freer, which is a bug, not a feature. Oh, and those many millions of people in Middle America who directly or indirectly rely on fracking and the rest of the fossil fuel industry? Even bloody-eyed, Gaffe-atronic Joe 3000 wants to shaft you. Better learn to code or something, because your good job is history. Weird how all the sacrifice once again falls on those out in the hinterlands and not on the blue coastal city swells, huh? But you’ll be able to rest easy knowing that our moral superiors in Brooklyn and Alexandria and Santa Monica enjoyed showing you sweaty rubes who’s really the boss by impoverishing you. Because that, and not the weather in a century, is and always has been what the “climate change” hoax is really all about.

"More nurses and midwives are leaving the profession in the UK than joining it, for the first time since 2008, figures show. The number registered in the UK fell by 1,783 to 690,773, in the year to March. The Nursing and Midwifery Council NMC said the downward trend had been most pronounced among British workers. Many leavers cited working conditions. But the government said there were now 13,000 more nurses working in hospitals in England than in 2010. In April and May this year, there was a more dramatic fall in those leaving nursing and midwifery, with a further 3,264 workers going. Other than retirement, the main reasons given for leaving were working conditions - including staffing levels and workload - personal circumstances and disillusion with quality of care to patients, according to an NMC survey of more than 4,500 leavers. Other reasons included leaving the UK and poor pay and benefits. Boris Johnson joins calls to end pay cap 'I'm swapping nursing for botox' Saffron Cordery, director of policy and strategy at NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, said: These figures provide further evidence of the severe workforce problems NHS trusts face. This goes beyond the concerns over Brexit - worrying though they are. The reduction in numbers is most pronounced among UK registrants. And it is particularly disappointing to see so many of our younger nurses and midwives choosing to leave. She said a new staff retention programme would offer support to those NHS trusts with the highest leaving rates. However, until we address the underlying issues driving retention problems, including the pay cap and the unsustainable workplace pressures, these approaches will only have a limited impact. Nurses protesting against the pay capimage copyrightEPA image captionNurses protested against the 1% public sector pay cap in June line Analysis: Nick Triggle, BBC health correspondent The figures being flagged up by the Nursing and Midwifery Council are for those registered to work in the UK. That is, of course, important - without a ready supply, the NHS cannot recruit the staff it needs. But the figure that is perhaps of most interest to the public is how many are actually working in the health service - and whether that is enough. The Department of Health in England has made this point, highlighting figures showing there are more than 13,000 more nurses working in hospitals than there were in 2010. But if you look at the overall number working in the NHS - once you include the likes of district nurses and those working in mental health - the number has risen by only 5,000 to nearly 286,000. That is because the rise in hospital nurses has been partly offset by a fall elsewhere. What is more, if you consider the number the NHS wants to employ but cannot - by adding on the number of vacancies - you find that the health service is well short of what it needs. Earlier this year, research by the Royal College of Nursing showed there were 40,000 unfilled posts - double the number from three years ago. line The Royal College of Nursing RCN said poor working conditions and the vicious cycle of staffing levels had contributed to the number of nurses leaving the profession. RCN chief executive Janet Davies added that the NHS had resorted to a quick fix by bringing in people from overseas to fill the gap left by the lack of British nurses. She believes the decision on how much nurses are paid is political. She added: [The government is also] removing the funding of the training of our future nurses. In September it will be the first time we see nurses coming in and having to take a loan. We know that's put people off, we haven't seen the actual figures but we know it's really low in some places and of course that just went into savings. Nurses and midwives previously received bursaries during their studies, but the government announced it would cease the NHS bursaries system from 1 August 2017, meaning students in many healthcare fields will now have to repay the cost of their degrees. The RCN called on the government to scrap the 1% public sector pay cap as a matter of urgency to prevent more health workers leaving. A Department of Health spokeswoman said: We are making sure we have the nurses we need to continue delivering world-class patient care - that's why there are almost 13,100 more on our wards since May 2010 and 52,000 in training. We also know we need to retain our excellent nurses and earlier this week we launched a national programme to ensure nurses have the support they need to continue their vital work.",TRUE
"Hunter Ribarchak, 7, rides on the Iron Workers of America's float during the annual Labor Day Parade in Pittsburgh, Pa., Monday, Sept. 1, 2008. Labor Day is traditionally a time for picnics and parades. But this year is no picnic for American workers, and a protest march would be more appropriate than a parade. Not only are 25 million unemployed or underemployed, but American companies continue to cut wages and benefits. The median wage is still dropping, adjusted for inflation. High unemployment has given employers extra bargaining leverage to wring out wage concessions. All told, it’s been the worst decade for American workers in a century. According to Commerce Department data, private-sector wage gains over the last decade have even lagged behind wage gains during the decade of the Great Depression (4 percent over the last ten years, adjusted for inflation, versus 5 percent from 1929 to 1939). Big American corporations are making more money, and creating more jobs, outside the United States than in it. Big American corporations are making more money, and creating more jobs, outside the United States than in it. If corporations are people, as the Supreme Court’s twisted logic now insists, most of the big ones headquartered here are rapidly losing their American identity. CEO pay, meanwhile, has soared. The median value of salaries, bonuses and long-term incentive awards for CEOs at 350 big American companies surged 11 percent last year to $9.3 million (according to a study of proxy statements conducted for The Wall Street Journal by the management consultancy Hay Group.). Bonuses have surged 19.7 percent. This doesn’t even include all those stock options rewarded to CEOs at rock-bottom prices in 2008 and 2009. Stock prices have ballooned since then, the current downdraft notwithstanding. In March, 2009, for example, Ford CEO Alan Mulally received a grant of optionsand restricted shares worth an estimated $16 million at the time. But Ford is now showing large profits – in part because the UAW agreed to allow Ford to give its new hires roughly half the wages of older Ford workers – and its share prices have responded. Mulally’s 2009 grant is now worth over $200 million. The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression. The ratio of corporate profits to wages is now higher than at any time since just before the Great Depression. Meanwhile, the American economy has all but stopped growing – in large part because consumers (whose spending is 70 percent of GDP) are also workers whose jobs and wages are under assault. Perhaps there would still be something to celebrate on Labor Day if government was coming to the rescue. But Washington is paralyzed, the president seems unwilling or unable to take on labor-bashing Republicans, and several Republican governors are mounting direct assaults on organized labor (see Indiana, Ohio, Maine and Wisconsin, for example). So let’s bag the picnics and parades this Labor Day. American workers should march in protest. They’re getting the worst deal they’ve had since before Labor Day was invented – and the economy is suffering as a result.",TRUE

"FORMER President Olusegun Obasanjo, on Saturday, declared that in Nigeria today, over 14 million children that should be in school were not in school, and thereby deprived of education. Obasanjo made this known in Lagos at the virtual 2020 Fellowship Graduation Ceremony of the second cohort of “Teach for Nigeria Fellows”. The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that “Teach For Nigeria”, an NGO, graduated 161 fellows who have impacted approximately 9,660 students in 80 schools across Lagos, Ogun, and the Kaduna States. NAN reports that “Teach For Nigeria” focuses on developing a movement of leaders across Nigeria who are committed to putting an end to educational inequity. Obasanjo said: “They are deprived of opportunities that will allow them to develop their abilities and become useful to themselves and their communities. “It is evident that at this point, to transform our education system in a sustainable way, Nigerian youths must take up leadership positions.” According to him, our youths must champion different innovative solutions at every level of the society and across different sectors. “It is inspiring to see the work that ‘Teach For Nigeria’ is doing to equip promising future leaders with the skills and experience to drive the change that we need,” the former president said. He added that the leaders had dedicated their time, energy and resources to inspire love for learning, improved educational outcomes, and enhanced life opportunities for children in the classrooms. “As a result of your commitment, your pupils have succeeded at various academic and non-academic competitions. “I recently learnt about pupils of ‘Teach For Nigeria Fellows’ who came second in the National Lafarge Competition and other scholarship opportunities. “They also initiated actions by working with stakeholders such as parents, community members, heads of schools and other teachers,” Obasanjo said. He, however, advised the fellows to continue to leverage their acquired skills and experiences to advocate for educational excellence in the country. The former president urged them to be ambassadors for change, driving the movement for freedom and justice in Nigeria. “I strongly advise that you remain resilient in your fight for educational equity, not relenting on the strides of deploying solutions to tackle the myriads of problems confronting our education system. “Please do not let anybody tell you that you are leaders of tomorrow, you are leaders today,” Obasanjo said. Also, Folawe Omikunle, the Chief Executive Officer, Teach For Nigeria, said that graduating fellows had spent the past two years improving the academic outcomes of their pupils. Omikunle said that they ignited the love for learning in these pupils, instilling self-belief, successfully galvanizing parental and community support to aid pupils learning process. “The graduating 161 fellows are joining our maiden set of 44 Alumni members, thereby bringing the number of our Alumni network to 205 members. “Teach For Nigeria is a lifelong commitment in the fight against educational inequity. “We are positive that our Alumni will continue to work toward ensuring that one day we have a Nigeria where every child can attain an excellent education,” she said.

"Proctor, VT — According to NBC News, a pastor at the Christian Proctor Church in Vermont, has been sentenced to one year in federal prison after refusing to marry gay couples. This comes shortly after the Supreme Court’s 5-4 decisionruling that states must allow gay marriage. The Christian Pastor, 56-year-old Paul Horner, had his lawyer speak to reporters on his behalf. “We are currently disputing the guilty verdict and I am confident my client will be a free man here shortly,” said attorney Tom Downey. “Horner was just using his best judgement according to his rights and religious freedom in this country.” The Honorable Myron Danus handed down the harsh sentence. “Religious freedom goes both ways, Mr. Horner,” Danus told a packed courtroom. “It is not your place to deny individuals the same rights that everyone else has, rights that were passed down and agreed upon in a court of law, the ultimate court, the Supreme Court. It is not your decision whether or not you agree with the law but more importantly that you follow it and enforce it.” According to the criminal investigation, the Christian Proctor Church is registered with the state as a “religious corporation” limited to performing “one-man-one-woman marriages as defined by the Holy Bible.” But the church is also registered as a for-profit business and city officials said that means the owners must comply with state and federal regulations. Steve Shand president of the Vermont Family Research Committee, said it is “open season on Americans who refuse to bow to the government’s redefinition of marriage.” “Homosexuals are gay,” Shand told reporters. “Why should Christian ministers be forced to perform and celebrate any marriage that conflicts with their beliefs? It’s a slippery slope my friend. Pretty soon these same pastors will be forced to wed animals or kitchen appliances. This is not my America!” Gwen Hawkins who is president of the LGBT Pride Center in Vermont said she is happy with the guilty verdict. “We just want the same rights as everyone else and this guilty verdict sets a great precedent,” Hawkins said. “These fanatical Christians base their life on one verse in the Bible but they seem to forget the other 99% of the verses in the book. For example, why can’t we stone to death Bristol Palin for having a baby out of wedlock? And what about her mother, Sarah Palin, breaking the rules of Corinthians 14:34 which clearly state that as a woman, she is not allowed to teach or to assume authority over a man; she must be quiet. But no, they like to pick the one verse in the Bible about gay people and build their camp around it.” Proctor is a town in Rutland County, Vermont, United States.

"MONTGOMERY, Ala., Jan. 12, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- The Alabama Supreme Court has ruled that a chemical endangerment statute must protect children who have not been born yet. The strongly worded ruling is the most important affirmation of the personhood of the pre-born child since the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.  The case was appealed to the AL Supreme Court by Amanda Kimbrough, a mother who admits that she smoked meth three days before her baby was born at 25 weeks. Tragically, baby Timmy lived for only a few minutes. The autopsy showed that the baby died from methamphetamine exposure.  The Alabama Supreme Court has dealt a massive blow to the constitutional fraud of Roe v. Wade by recognizing that the preborn child is a person, explained Personhood USA Legal Analyst Gualberto Garcia Jones, J.D.

Kimbrough's attorney had previously debated Personhood Alabama founding member Attorney Ben DuPre on CNN. Kimbrough's attorney claimed in the interview that their case hinged upon the fact that the law regarding methamphetamine exposure to children did not apply to unborn children, only to born children.  The New York Times covered Kimbrough's case in in April, when she was found guilty of a Class A felony. The article quoted assistant district attorney Angela Hulsey as stating, She caused the death of another person, a person that will never have the chance to go to school, go to the prom, get married, have children of their own. You're dealing with the most innocent of victims.  The Alabama Supreme Court agreed with Hulsey, stating in their ruling that, The decision of this Court today is in keeping with the widespread legal recognition that unborn children are persons with rights that should be protected by law.

For what it’s worth, I have consulted with a number of federal budget experts and they confirm several things: 1) The ACA is already paid for, so accepting federal dollars will not add one dollar to the federal deficit. 2) If Texas does not accept the Medicaid expansion, the balance of the tax dollars Texans pay and what we receive will tip dramatically ($9 billion a year) towards us receiving less money than we pay in taxes. Further, because the Medicaid expansion funds are fungible, unused dollars will be spent on other things, including insuring patients in other states. So, while you cannot track an individual tax dollar through the system for ANY purpose, if is a common-sense statement that if next year Texas turns down money, continues to pay more than it receives in federal tax dollars, and billions are spent insuring people in other states, yes, our tax dollars will be spent to insure people in other states.

"Nation  U.S. STATE GOVERNORS NAMES ON CHINA COMMUNIST PARTY **MEMBERSHIP** LIST  A database obtained by computer hackers from China Communist Party computers allegedly reveals the names of more than a DOZEN U.S. State Governors who are reportedly shown in the database as being MEMBERS of China's Communist Party:  The database was originally leaked on Telegram, the encrypted instant messaging app, and passed in September by a Chinese dissident to the Inter-Parliamentary Alliance on China, which comprises more than 150 legislators around the world who are concerned by the influence and activities of the Chinese government. Here is a statement from IPAC about the data:  Detailed analysis by U.S. Intelligence sources say the list is genuine!  The list mostly includes the details of CCP members based in Shanghai, in more than 79,000 branches, or cells. The CCP's total membership currently stands at more than 92 million, with a success rate of around 10 percent for aspiring members.  China Communist Party CCP members have infiltrated not only some of the largest corporations of the US, Australia and the UK, but also many consulates and government agencies, giving them access to sensitive and no doubt compromising information that would give the CCP an edge on the world stage.  Make no mistake, these agents ultimately answer directly to the party and Chairman Xi Jinping.  This is a fascinating look inside the CCP’s infiltration network and gives us an idea of just how deeply their agents have been embedded.  The original database in Chinese contains some 1.95 million names, the majority from Shanghai, many complete with National ID number & personal details, but also contains the details of some 79,000 communist party branches, many of them INSIDE the companies they have infiltrated. Some of the names are listed as having been “executed” while others have notes regarding organs and a price.  Take a quick look at how the CCP works:  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger who ran what may be the most fraudulent election in the nation on November 3, where President Trump lost the traditionally Red State, has a brother. Meet Brother, Ron Raffensperger CTO for HUAWEI Enterprise Storage Solutions, the Data Storage Company of . . . . the CCP.  The same Chinese Communist Party CCP that paid DOMINION $400 million through a subsidiary of HSBC, a month or so BEFORE the November 3 election, which may have gotten the CCP the ability to update Dominion voting software for the then-upcoming U.S. Presidential Election!  Elsewhere, other key people are tunring out to have strong connections to the CCP. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson – currently obstructing efforts to investigate Michigan’s election results – developed ties with Chinese state-run universities and trained lawyers for the Chinese Communist Party – even delivering a lecture at Chinese Premier Xi Jinping’s alma mater.    Benson undertook the work aiding the Chinese Communist Party while serving as the Dean of Wayne Law School in Detroit, Michigan.  Being the CTO for a mega corporation like HUAWEI pays huge bucks. Maybe some of that money is going to a certain Secretary of State? Who knows what's happening between the two brothers . . . maybe at the behest of the CCP?  China's infiltration efforts have been vast. Major aerospace companies Airbus, Rolls-Royce, and Boeing have employed hundreds of CCP members. Additionally, Pfizer and British drugmaker AstraZeneca COVID-19 Vaccine developer! employed a total of 123 Party members. British automaker Jaguar Land Rover also employed CCP members.  Now, back to the USA. The Governors allegedly named in the database are listed below:    AZ - Ducey    AR - Hutchinson    CA - Newsome    CT - Lamont    NM - Grisham    VT - Scott    IA - Reynolds    RI - Raimondo    NE - Ricketts    DE - Carney    IN - Holcomb    NV - Sisolak    TN - Lee    KY - Beshear    ID - Little    MT - Bullock    OR - Brown    IL - Pritzker    LA - Edwards    TX - Abbott    MN - Waltz    MA- Baker  NC-Cooper    UT - Herbert  Other names totaling 1.9 Million people, are also on the list, which is still being sorted and translated. The process of translating is taking longer than expected, but it looks like this: Click image to enlarge  POMPEO WARNED THEM ALL  Earlier this year, U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, spoke at the National Governor's Association Winter Meeting and HE WARNED GOVERNORS they were being targeted by China. He told the Governors that China was doing harm to the US and to our industries, and they were moving to manipulate Governors into doing things that would help China AT THE EXPENSE of America. Pompeo warned them all to be careful.  The warning apparently came too late because based on the information outlined above, obtained from computer hackers, it SEEMS that several U.S. State Governors may have already sold-out and become Communists.  COMMUNISM ILLEGAL IN THE UNITED STATES  The Communist Party is unlawful in the United States. It's very existence is banned by federal law. Here is the law:  Of course, while the federal law above bans the Communist Party of the United States, it does NOT ban the Communist Party of China. The question then becomes, have these Governors become members of the China Communist Party CCP for the SAME PURPOSE as that previously espoused by the Communist Party of the United States? Same political ideology . . . same goal?  Folks who live in states whose Governor's name appears on the CCP Member List, need to make a major fuss about this and find out what's what.  If your Governor is a Communist, then your Governor has to go.  Now.  No exceptions.

"Nancy Pelosi’s office spent the day denying what her own daughters spilled earlier this week at a kegger in San Dimas: Speaker Pelosi will NOT be seeking another term as a US Congresswoman. According to Brandon Kyle, a friend of Cassandra Pelosi:  “She totally said her mom was retiring. Like…30 people heard it. Her sister Marisol was upstairs doing that thing she does with a Zagnut and confirmed it to at least 16 girls and one undecided that we know of.”  When asked how credible the source was, we were told “regardless of how credible the source is, the information is true,” which explains everything.  The mainstream media has been told not to report it.  That won’t stop the truth from getting out, however, as more people find Cassie’s story and hunt down Kyle. Our own investigator in the field, Skip Tetheluda, says he found the sources to be fully credible:  “I went expecting to find a bunch of losers looking to score some cash on inside info and instead found a bunch of complete idiots who didn’t understand how valuable their information was. I sat and burned one with Mikey and Rich and they gave me the whole scoop. Yeah, she’s retiring all right.”  Skip’s reputation is unmatched in our circles, so we’re gonna go ahead and pass this information along.

Though the agency claims to use “impartial mediation practices and conflict resolution procedures,” press reports along with the documents obtained by Judicial Watch suggest that the unit deployed to Sanford, FL, took an active role in working with those demanding the prosecution of Zimmerman. On April 15, 2012, during the height of the protests, the Orlando Sentinel reported, “They [the CRS] helped set up a meeting between the local NAACP and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police Chief Bill Lee according to Turner Clayton, Seminole County chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.” The paper quoted the Rev. Valarie Houston, pastor of Allen Chapel AME Church, a focal point for protestors, as saying “They were there for us,” after a March 20 meeting with CRS agents. Separately, in response to a Florida Sunshine Law request to the City of Sanford, Judicial Watch also obtained an audio recording of a “community meeting” held at Second Shiloh Missionary Baptist Church in Sanford on April 19, 2012. The meeting, which led to the ouster of Sanford’s Police Chief Bill Lee, was scheduled after a group of college students calling themselves the “Dream Defenders” barricaded the entrance to the police department demanding Lee be fired. According to the Orlando Sentinel, DOJ employees with the CRS had arranged a 40-mile police escort for the students from Daytona Beach to Sanford. “These documents detail the extraordinary intervention by the Justice Department in the pressure campaign leading to the prosecution of George Zimmerman,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “My guess is that most Americans would rightly object to taxpayers paying government employees to help organize racially-charged demonstrations.”",partially false
"What group of people in America hates our military and isn’t afraid to show it? Democrats. Obama devastated our military, providing virtually no funding to it for eight long years.  He cut our troop size in half, sold off equipment, and often refused to even provide paychecks. They didn’t even have ammunition.  Obama was equally unkind to veterans. The Veteran’s Affairs office had its budget cut in half during his terrible reign. Those who had previously served us were made to feel worthless and unwanted.  Fortunately, President Trump was elected, and in just three short years he successfully reversed the damage from the previous administration, damage that many had thought would never be recovered from.  Now, Kamala Harris wants to take our vets back to the hell they had experienced under BHO. That was somewhat to be expected, but no details have yet been given except for one very significant one announced by Kamala Harris today.  Harris made an announcement before some group in Chicago:  “The United States government cannot continue to pay for the every need of what has become a special class of citizen. Veterans are equal to us, not better than. Veterans Affairs coddles them. It creates a dependency upon us which is not doing these former soldiers any good. They need to learn to live on their own two feet and be responsible adults. The easiest way to assist them on this journey is to cut them off. Within these next four years, we will be shuttering the VA, taking away soldier welfare. The money saved will go to better use in assisting refugee families. These poor folks seek asylum with us and need a boost and it is our responsibility as a nation to provide it. So here’s a message to the soldier boys. Get a job.”  This woman has a lot of nerve speaking to our brave military personnel in that way. These men and women sacrificed themselves for this country. Harris has never even come close to doing such a thing.",FALSE
"Words scaled by the frequency that President Trump has used them in tweets during his term in office, according to the Trump Twitter Archive. WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump spent much of the 2020 presidential campaign insisting that he could only lose if the election was rigged against him, and he has spent nearly every day since his defeat claiming his dire predictions of fraud had come to pass. But just as he cried foul before a single vote was cast – something he also did in 2016 – Trump has maintained he was robbed of victory without any credible evidence to support that belief. Despite assurances from his own departments of Justice and Homeland Security that no serious fraud occurred, Trump has raged against the election result and mounted a relentless campaign to reverse President-elect Joe Biden's 306-232 Electoral College win. More: Congress' count of Electoral College votes could be most contentious in 144 years. Here are past dramatic moments The president, his lawyers and his allies have filed scores of lawsuits; made repeated allegations of election fraud in news and social media; organized protests; tried to convince state legislatures to take action; and held hearings in various state houses, hotel ballrooms and, at one point, a landscaping company. And on Wednesday, 13 senators and more than 100 Republican lawmakers plan to object to the certification of Biden's win when Congress meets in a joint session. All those efforts to overturn the election can be a bit dizzying, so USA TODAY has broken it down by the numbers to help make sense of it all. Election lawsuits: 62 The president and his allies filed 62 lawsuits in state and federal courts seeking to overturn election results in states the president lost, according to Marc Elias, a Democratic election lawyer who is tracking the outcomes. Election lawsuit defeats: 61 Out of the 62 lawsuits filed challenging the presidential election, 61 have failed, according to Elias. Some cases were dismissed for lack of standing and others based on the merits of the voter fraud allegations. The decisions have came from both Democratic-appointed and Republican-appointed judges – including federal judges appointed by Trump. More: 'It really is over now': The 24 hours that likely thwarted Trump's effort to overturn the election State Supreme Courts in Arizona, Nevada and Arizona each rejected or declined to hear Trump’s appeals to overturn results in those states, while the Pennsylvania and Michigan supreme courts denied multiple lawsuits. The 60th and 61st losses came in recent days. Last Friday, a Trump-appointed federal judge in Texas dismissed a lawsuit from Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, that argued Vice President Mike Pence has the conditional power to decide which states' Electoral College votes to count. More: A look at what several state supreme courts said about rejecting attempts to overturn Biden's election win On Monday, a federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed by voters in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Michigan and Arizona that argued state legislatures should have met after the election to certify votes. The lone victory for the Trump team was a small one. A Pennsylvania judge sided with the Trump campaign, ruling that voters could not go back and “cure” their ballots if they failed to provide proper identification three days after the election. The ruling affected few votes and did not change the outcome in Pennsylvania, which Biden won by 81,660 votes. Number of contested states: 6 The vast majority of the lawsuits were in six pivotal battleground states that Biden won: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump won five of the states four years ago in his victory over Hillary Clinton, but Biden flipped each to the Democratic column. House Republicans who plan to object to Electoral College results Wednesday said they plan to target these same six states. Number of times the US Supreme Court sided against Trump: 2 The U.S. Supreme Court twice refused to take up Trump-endorsed lawsuits that sought to overturn the results of the Nov. 3 election. In a one-sentence denial, the Supreme Court on Dec. 8 rejected a request from Pennsylvania Republicans that sought to overturn Biden's win in the state. The challenge, led Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., claimed that the Republican-led state legislature's expansion of absentee voting violated the state's constitution. Three days later, the Supreme Court refused to let Texas challenge the election results in four battleground states critical to Trump's defeat. The court said Texas did not demonstrate ""a judicially cognizable interest in the manner in which another state conducts its elections."" Number of recounts: 3 Georgia held two recounts of its presidential election results, both reaffirming Biden's win in the state. Wisconsin had one recount that confirmed Biden's victory there. The first recount in Georgia – a hand recount ordered by the state – found Biden won by 12,284 votes, a narrower margin than the 14,196-vote lead he held immediately following the election. Local election administrators identified uncounted ballots in four counties. Each was the result of human error. The second recount in Georgia – one requested by the Trump campaign – narrowed Biden's victory to 11,779 votes Votes Trump gained from recounts: 2,343 In Wisconsin, Biden gained 74 votes following a partial recount of the state's results that focused only on two Democratic strongholds, Milwaukee and Dane counties. It increased Biden's statewide margin to 20,682 votes out of about 3 million cast. Adding the differences in both states together, Trump gained 2,343 votes as a result of the Georgia and Wisconsin recounts. Number of elections Trump has claimed were rigged: At least 6 This is not the first time Trump has declared an election had been ""rigged"" or ""stolen."" On Election Day in 2012, when President Barack Obama defeated his Republican challenger Mitt Romney, Trump tweeted that there were ""reports of voting machines switching Romney votes to Obama."" ""Pay close attention to the machines, don't let your vote be stolen,"" he said. Four years later, when Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, defeated Trump in the Iowa caucuses, Trump tweeted, ""Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad!"" Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it. That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated. Bad! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016 Trump also said the 2016 Democratic primary was ""rigged"" against Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and, as in 2020, he declared the 2016 general election race was ""rigged"" against him before it even took place. Even after winning the election and being sworn in as president, Trump baselessly insisted more than 3 million illegal votes were cast against him. A White House commission Trump created to investigate election fraud disbanded without finding any evidence to support the president's claims. Trump went on to allege ""fraud"" in the 2018 midterm elections and to imply there was something nefarious about the late changing vote totals in tight races, though such changes are routine in close elections where projections cannot be made immediately. Just out — in Arizona, SIGNATURES DON’T MATCH. Electoral corruption - Call for a new Election? We must protect our Democracy! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 9, 2018 The president also declared in 2020, without evidence, that the Democratic primary had once again been ""rigged"" against Sanders. Number of electoral votes changed as the result of Trump's effort: 0 Despite all the lawsuits, recounts and false voter fraud allegations, the Electoral College on Dec. 14 elected Biden the next president by a margin of 306 to 232 – marking no change in the electoral outcome. Biden finished with a record 81,281,502 votes nationally, defeating Trump in the popular vote by a sizable 7 million votes. With 51.3% of the national popular vote, Biden won with the highest share of the vote for a challenger of an incumbent president since Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1932. Trump won 46.8% of the vote nationally. Days until Biden's inauguration Wednesday's joint session of Congress will have procedural fireworks as 13 U.S. senators and more than 100 Republican House members plan to object to electoral votes from potentially six battleground states that Biden won. But the efforts are doomed to fail, lacking the votes in the Democratic-controlled House and even in the Republican-led Senate. Because each objection could lead to hours of debate in the House and Senate, the session could be a marathon. But in the end, Biden and Harris will be inaugurated as the next president and vice president at noon on Jan. 20.",TRUE
"We all know that Democrats do not care about senior citizens. It’s almost like they have no elderly family members themselves. Of course, they do and we can only assume they don’t care about them either.  The latest Democrat scheme involves AOC, yet again trying to muck up our Social Security system.  This is her latest proposal is a doozy:  “Look, these people are a burden on society. This is a capitalist society in which we let the weak die so that the strong may thrive, so that is what I intend to do. Seniors get enough handouts as it is, so I say we put a cap on it. If you reach the age of 75 and still can’t support yourself on your own, then perhaps you made bad life choices. Maybe they should pull themselves up by the bootstraps or something. Why should the taxpayer have to subsidize your poor decisions? They will no longer have to under my proposal.”  These are such horrible words coming from someone that is supposed to represent “we the people.”  She is casting aside seniors as second-class like Republicans typically do to anyone who isn’t rich. What’s next? Taking away their right to vote? This is a very dangerous and wet slippery slope that we cannot afford to go down. There is too much at stake.  Luckily, many Republicans agree, including our very own, Senator Joe Barron. He said he has confirmed that he will be voting next month to impeach AOC for “unlawful acts,” whatever that means. This sounds like a good first step in the right direction.  For years, Republicans have chipped away at social net programs that progressives like AOC normally support.

"I WILL BE UPDATING THIS ARTICLE AS I FIND MORE  As seen in the clipping below, the Verified Department of Homeland Security’s Account in the Associated Press’s “OneWire” content accumulation service speaks about the DHS’s Election Audit and how it determined sharp inaccuracies in the election in favor of Joe Biden. Before we dive into the post on OneWire, we need to discuss a few things.  What Is AP News’s OneWire?  OneWire is the name of a service that connects agencies and reporters from across the planet together. Their job is simple. Make a platform that makes it easy to share information between verified sources in order to cut down on misinformation. Hence the name “Associated Press” and “OneWire”. OneWire can only be accessed by content providers and sharing partners in the news networks in the United States and abroad.  Can I Read AP OneWire Articles?  The general public cannot read AP OneWire press releases until a provider or other journal agency releases the text of that article for public viewing. Once that occurs, it is called a “lead off”. A lead off will act as a source for the information. Sometimes, these articles are leaked before they are shared by content providers, such is the case as I will allow you to see it.  DHS’s Press Release  Notes: This release is not public. I can share the link all I want, and unless you have an AP OneWire account through your employer, you simply will not be able to view it.

"Based on actual results and accounting for states currently not called, still counting, recounting, under investigation or audit, or states with election issues now in the courts, President Trump is winning the 2020 Presidential Election. Per consideration for all the states still in question, President Trump is currently winning the 2020 election. Here is what we already know. A number of states have been called but a number are still in question. Here is a list of those in question. Pennsylvania – although the current counts show Biden leading there is so much corruption in this state that it is likely that this state will never come to a transparent and agreed upon decision on who wins this state. President Trump was up by 700,000 votes on election night but more than a million ballots were added since that which eventually stole the election for Biden. The President has a clear path to victory once the illegal votes are addressed. TRENDING: You Son of a Bitch! YOU PUNK! - Geraldo LOSES IT ON LIVE TV after Dan Bongino Lays Him Out on Hannity! VIDEO Wisconsin – this state as well now shows Biden in the lead but early in the morning after the election more than 100,000 votes magically appeared in Milwaukee. The current lead for Biden is only 20,000. If these votes or the exception in the numbers in Rock County are addressed, Trump will likely win this state by a large margin. Michigan – this state is as well full of fraud. Lawsuits are in place. In addition there were over 100,000 votes dumped in Detroit and the lead here was stolen from Trump as well. Once the illegal votes are eliminated President Trump has a very good chance of winning this state as well. Georgia – this state too has much fraud. The President was winning this state on election night by 100,000 votes. But after the election a program was put in place to basically harvest a number of ballots. Now Biden leads in this state as well. Once the harvested ballots are thrown out, this state will go to Trump as well. Nevada – there is much fraud here as well. Signatures were not verified on hundreds of thousands of votes. It is likely that President Trump will win this state if any of the ineligible votes are eliminated here as well.

"by Brian Shilhavy  Editor, Health Impact News  The UK Government’s reporting system for COVID vaccine adverse reactions from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency released their latest report today, March 4, 2021.

"WOODSIDE — She was a high school dropout at 15. Then a grocery clerk, then a Harvard MBA, then a rock star high tech executive. At 37, having revolutionized the dot-com world by helping to create Amazon, she quit to lead another, more personal startup: her own life. Joy Covey often went rock climbing and kite-boarding, and undertook her greatest adventure with the birth of son Tyler eight years ago. She was 50 when she died Wednesday. Riding her bike down one of Skyline Boulevard’s treacherous hills, she collided with a van. Like so much else in Covey’s life, her death came suddenly, a shock to friends and admirers who never knew what to expect from her next. Before becoming an Internet pioneer, Covey was the restless daughter of a doctor and nurse, who were no doubt taken aback when she abruptly quit as a freshman at San Mateo High School, but not appalled. With a blazing IQ of 173 and an adventurer’s urge to try something new, instead of surrendering to boredom, she left home at 15. “I thought, ‘If I don’t obey, what can they do?’ ” Covey said in a 1999 interview with Fortune magazine, which had just named her to its list of Most Powerful Women in Business. “I decided, there’s no more following the rules.” Name some poets She passed the high school equivalency exam, then bagged groceries in Fresno for a while, graduated from Cal State-Fresno in 21/2 years, and scored second highest in the country on the exam to become a certified public accountant. A brief stint at the accounting firm Arthur Young led her to Harvard, where she earned an MBA and a law degree. She was the only member of her Harvard cohort to arrive with bragging rights over bagging both groceries and high school. “I was completely intimidated by the rest of the class,” Covey told the Harvard Law Bulletin in a 2002 interview. “Not having finished high school and having been fairly utilitarian in the way I went about college, I didn’t have a deep liberal arts background. So we’d go to lunch and people would talk about their favorite seventeenth-century poets, and I’d be thinking, ‘Could I even name five poets? From any century?’ It wasn’t until we got our first-semester grades back that I started to realize that everything was going to be OK.” Metamorphosis Amazon co-founder and CEO Jeff Bezos named the company after the Amazon River, which in turn was named after Greek mythology’s legendary nation of female warriors. That was Covey’s tribe after taking the position of chief financial officer at the fledgling online bookseller at age 33. When she joined Amazon, the company had 150 employees and annual losses that would soon grow into the hundreds of millions. She led Amazon’s IPO, counseling impatient Wall Street analysts to expect more red ink before profitability. By the time she quit to go skiing in 2000, Covey’s net worth was estimated at $200 million. Amazon now has 97,000 employees and a market capitalization of $142.6 billion, all of it based on a structure she put in place. She always insisted that she hadn’t retired, just gone through another metamorphosis. This one led her to pour energy and considerable money into the National Resources Defense Council, where she served on the board and as treasurer. In the cycling accident that killed her, the driver of the van, a 22-year-old Fremont man, had turned left in front of her from the oncoming lane at the last instant, according to CHP spokesman Arturo Montiel. He stayed at the scene and has not been cited in the incident. Montiel said the collision is still under investigation. Staff writer Joshua Melvin contributed to this report.

"In response to Gen David Petraeus' denunciation of Florida pastor Terry Jones' right to engage in a symbolic protest of the 9/11 attacks by burning copies of the Quran this Sept. 11, President Obama said: ""Let me be clear: As a citizen, and as president, I believe that members of the Dove World Outreach Center have the same right to freedom of speech and religion as anyone else in this country."" Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida lauded Obama's remarks, saying America is ""a place where you're supposed to be able to practice your religion without the government telling you you can't."" New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg called Obama's words a ""clarion defense of the freedom of religion"" -- and also claimed that he had recently run into a filthy jihadist who actually supported the Quran-burning! Keith Olbermann read the poem ""First they came ..."" on air in defense of the Quran-burners, nearly bringing himself to tears at his own profundity. No wait, my mistake. This is what liberals said about the ground zero mosque only five minutes ago when they were posing as First Amendment absolutists. Suddenly, they've developed amnesia when it comes to the free-speech right to burn a Quran. Weirdly, conservatives who opposed building the mosque at ground zero are also against the Quran burning. (Except in my case. It turns out I'm for it, but mostly because burning Qurans will contribute to global warming.) Liberals couldn't care less about the First Amendment. To the contrary, censoring speech and religion is the left's specialty! (Any religion other than Islam.) They promote speech codes, hate crimes, free speech zones (known as ""America"" off college campuses), and go around the country yanking every reference to God from the public square via endless lawsuits by the ACLU. Whenever you see a liberal choking up over our precious constitutional rights, you can be sure we're talking about the rights of Muslims at ground zero, ""God Hates Fags"" funeral protesters, strippers, The New York Times publishing classified documents, pornographers, child molesters, murderers, traitors, saboteurs, terrorists, flag-burners (but not Quran-burners!) or women living on National Endowment of the Arts grants by stuffing yams into their orifices on stage. Speaking of lying dwarfs, last week on ""The Daily Show"" Bloomberg claimed he was having a hamburger with his ""girlfriend"" when a man came up to him and said of the ground zero mosque: ""I just got back from two tours fighting overseas for America. This is what we were all fighting for. You go and keep at it."" We're fighting for the right of Muslims to build mosques at ground zero? I thought we were trying to keep Muslims AWAY from our skyscrapers. (What an embarrassing misunderstanding.) PLEASE PULL THE TROOPS OUT IMMEDIATELY. But back to the main issue: Was Bloomberg having a $150 Burger Double Truffle at DB Bistro Moderne or a more sensible $30 burger at the 21 Club when he bumped into his imaginary veteran? With the pint-sized mayor shrieking at the sight of a saltshaker, I assume he wasn't having a Hardee's No. 4 Combo Meal. Adding an element of realism to his little vignette, Bloomberg said: ""I got a hamburger and a pickle and a potato chip or something."" A potato chip? Translation: ""I don't know what I was eating, because I'm making this whole story up -- I wouldn't be caught dead eating 'a potato chip' or any other picaresque garnish favored by the peasants."" At least Bloomberg didn't claim the man who walked up to him took credit for setting the Times Square bomb because he was a tea partier upset about ObamaCare -- as Sherlock Bloomberg had so presciently speculated at the time. Gen. Petraeus objected to the Quran-burning protest on the grounds that it could be used by radical jihadists to recruit Muslims to attack Americans. This is what liberals say whenever we do anything displeasing to the enemy -- invade Iraq, hold captured terrorists in Guantanamo, interrogate captured jihadists or publish Muhammad cartoons. Is there a website somewhere listing everything that encourages terrorist recruiting? If the general's main objective is to hamper jihadist recruiting, may I respectfully suggest unconditional surrender? Because on his theory, you know what would really kill the terrorists' recruiting ability? If we adopted Sharia law! But wait -- weren't we assured by Fire Island's head of national security, Andrew Sullivan, that if America elected a ""brown-skinned man whose father was an African, who grew up in Indonesia and Hawaii, who attended a majority-Muslim school as a boy,"" the terrorists would look like a bunch of lunkheads and be unable to recruit? It didn't work out that way. There have been more terrorist attacks on U.S. soil by these allegedly calmed Muslims in Obama's first 18 months in office than in the six years under Bush after he invaded Iraq. Also, as I recall, there was no Guantanamo, no Afghanistan war and no Iraq war on Sept. 10, 2001. And yet, somehow, Osama bin Ladin had no trouble recruiting back then. Can we retire the ""it will help them recruit"" argument yet? The reason not to burn Qurans is that it's unkind -- not to jihadists, but to Muslims who mean us no harm. The same goes for building a mosque at ground zero -- in both cases, it's not a question of anyone's ""rights,"" it's just a nasty thing to do.",partially false
"The rookie politician’s first month looks a lot like his campaign. Congressman Conor Lamb was an unknown quantity when he won a special election in March that he wasn’t supposed to win, having run as a Democrat even Reaganites could love and refusing to fully toe the partisan line. It was a question of how all that would translate in elected office. He had no political experience and no voting record to point to and only platform points and campaign vows to serve as reference material. A month later, and that has changed. In the first weeks of what is to be a very brief term representing the 18th Congressional District — portions of which belong to Allegheny, Westmoreland, Greene and Washington counties — Lamb has voted with his fellow Democrats in the House and at times with the Republican majority. He’s voted in favor of measures to extend hate crime protections to law enforcement officers and against a Farm Bill containing controversial new work requirements for food stamp recipients. He’s voted with Congressman Keith Rothfus, Lamb’s Republican opponent in the ongoing race for Pennsylvania’s newly drawn 17th Congressional District, and against him. So the question is: If Lamb was billed as a political maverick, a moderate in immoderate times, does his voting record reflect that? Here we look at the votes cast by Lamb in his first weeks in office and preview what his votes might look like as a more permanent member of the U.S. House if he’s elected to represent the 17th in November. Multiple requests for comment were not returned. Legislation U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb - Democrat U.S. Rep.

The Volcker Rule was passed as part of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 under President Barack Obama and was meant to protect bank customers by preventing institutions from making certain types of speculative investments that contributed to the 2008 financial crisis. According to the New York Times, “the Volcker Rule, named for the former chairman of the Federal Reserve […] prohibited banks from making their own risky bets with their customers’ deposits. Banks loathed the rule and Republicans vowed to undo it.” The bill works by allowing thousands of small and midsize banks to avoid tougher oversight and, per the Washington Post, “also loosens rules aimed at protecting the biggest banks from sudden collapse.” The Post also reported that Paul Volcker, the former Fed chairman for whom the rule is named, criticized a similar bill in the U.S. Senate, saying “plausibly small loopholes can be ‘gamed’ and exploited with unfortunate consequences.” In the end, congressional Republicans succeeded with the help of Democrats like Lamb who was one of 78 Democrats to vote for the rollback. One hundred and fifteen Democrats cast votes against the rule change or didn’t vote at all, according to govtrack.us. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted to rollback the rule and later said at a town hall that his vote was based on the burden the regulation presented for smaller banks that he said don’t engage in the type of risky trading that the big banks did before the financial crisis of 2008, TribLive reported. Under the bill, community banks are defined as those without a controlling entity with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and trading liability that are more than 5 percent of total consolidated assets. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted in favor of the rollback. Where does it stand? The bill was passed by the House and referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, according to congress.gov. S. 2155 – Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act What is it? The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act is a more sweeping rollback of Dodd-Frank provisions. It aims to “ease the regulatory burden for small and midsize banks,” the same banks that argue the tougher regulations spurred by the 2008 financial crisis have unfairly made it more difficult for them to operate and compete. This includes community banks whose customers include small businesses, which critics of Dodd-Frank argue have been hurt by curtailed lending to small companies following the passage of Dodd-Frank in 2010. Critics of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, meanwhile, argue that it could embolden some of the financial sector’s worst tendencies, the same that contributed to or caused the financial collapse of 2008. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure, joining the vast majority of Democrats. In a press release, Lamb said of the bill: “With common-sense regulations in place to protect the money that consumers deposit, people can have more confidence that their bank will better protect their investments. Banks today are experiencing record-setting profits and it’s only fair that we continue to protect the interests of the taxpayers and avoid another bailout.” WESA described this as Lamb “straddling the partisan divide with two votes on bank rules.” How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted for the measure, joining almost all of his fellow Republicans. In a statement, Rothfus said: “Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day. This has meant that consumers have faced higher costs and reduced access to vital financial products. By fixing misguided rules from Washington, this bill will help consumers and small businesses access the financial services they need to live their version of the American Dream.” Where does it stand? President Trump signed the bill into law Thursday. H.R. 5698 – Protect and Serve Act of 2018 What is it? The Protect and Serve Act of 2018 is modeled after a federal hate crime statute and would make it a crime to intentionally target a law enforcement officer based on his “actual or perceived status” as one, CNN reports. Supporters say the bill sends a clear signal that violence against law enforcement officers will not be tolerated. Critics say the language of the bill is too broad and effectively designates any violence against officers a federal hate crime. They also argue that it perpetuates a false narrative of a “war on police” and that police already have substantial protections under state and federal law and do not qualify as a historically persecuted group. How did Lamb vote? Lamb, whose background as a federal prosecutor and Marine Corps JAG officer were regular features of his campaign, voted in favor of the bill. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. He was one of 162 Democrats to vote in favor of the bill, while 24 voted against it and seven didn’t vote, according to govtrack.us. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted in favor of the measure. There were 220 Republicans who cast yes votes for the legislation, 11 who did not, and three who didn’t vote at all. All of the bill’s sponsors were Republicans. Where does it stand? The bill passed the House and has been referred to the Senate’s Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 2152 – Citizens’ Right to Know Act of 2018 What is it? This bill requires a state or local government that receives funds under a Department of Justice (DOJ) grant program and uses such funds for a pretrial services program to annually report to DOJ the amount of money allocated for the pretrial services program and certain information about participating defendants. DOJ must publish the information. Additionally, DOJ must reduce the grant allocation of a state or local government that fails to comply. Supporters argue the bill would provide greater transparency in how federal funds are used by local governments. Critics, including the ACLU, NAACP and Human Rights Watch, say the bill presents “serious privacy concerns” and also “undermines efforts to eliminate or reduce jurisdictions’ reliance on money bail systems.” How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure, joining a majority of Democrats. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted yes, along with all but 8 Republican voters in the House. What happened? The bill passed the House and has been referred to the Senate’s Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 5645 – Standard Merger and Acquisition Reviews Through Equal Rules Act of 2018 What is it? According to Law 360: The SMARTER Act would eliminate differences between the DOJ and FTC’s approaches to merger challenges by requiring the FTC to litigate contested merger challenges in federal court, rather than through its administrative review process. Proponents of the SMARTER Act argue that it provides greater certainty for companies by reconciling the disparate processes used by the FTC and DOJ. Opponents view the proposal as an attack on the FTC’s ability to properly carry out its duties, unnecessarily weakening the FTC by removing this enforcement tool from its powers. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure, joining all but four Democrats. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted in favor of the measure in what amounted to a party-line vote. Where does it stand? H.R. 5645 passed the House and was referred to the Senate’s Committee on the Judiciary. H.R. 2: Agriculture and Nutrition Act of 2018 (Farm Bill) What is it? The Farm Bill is a multi-year spending bill covering an array of agricultural and food programs — everything from farm commodity price and income supports, agricultural conservation, farm credit, trade, research, rural development, bioenergy, foreign food aid, and domestic nutrition assistance, the Congressional Research Service reports. This year’s proposal was controversial for its proposed cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the proposed addition of work requirements for SNAP recipients. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against the measure with all 183 Democrats who cast votes May 18. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted no, joining only 30 Republican lawmakers who opposed the measure. “While this bill began necessary reforms to agriculture and nutrition programs, in an era of a nearly $21 trillion national debt, more reforms are needed,” Rothfus said in a statement. “Congress needs to be very careful in how it spends hard-earned taxpayer dollars. This bill was a missed opportunity for serious reforms of agricultural subsidy programs.” Of the 30 Republicans to vote no on the Farm Bill proposal, NPR reports many are members of the House Freedom Caucus and that they voted no after failing to get concessions on spending and a future vote on immigration in exchange for their support. Rothfus was a member of the House Freedom Caucus until resigning in 2016. Where does the bill stand? The bill failed in the House in a 198-213 and has yet to be scheduled for further proceedings. H.R. 3053 – Nuclear Waste Policy Amendments Act of 2018 What is it? H.R. 3053 is a bill to authorize the Department of Energy to resume a plan — halted under the Obama administration — to build the Yucca Mountain facility to store radioactive nuclear waste. Supporters of H.R. 3053 say waste is piling up at power plants nationwide because Yucca Mountain is unavailable. Critics point to safety concerns and “government bullying” in explaining their opposition. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted for the bill to restart the program, joining 221 Republicans and 119 members of his own party. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus also voted in favor of the bill. Where does it stand? Referred to Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. H.R. 3144 – To provide for operations of the Federal Columbia River Power System pursuant to a certain operation plan for a specified period of time, and for other purposes What is it? The bill, sponsored by U.S. Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Spokane, would reverse a federal judge’s order calling for more springtime spill over on dams along the Columbia and Snake Rivers in the Northwest to protect endangered salmon. The bill would lock in place management plans that the judge found violated federal environmental laws, according to High Country News. How did Lamb vote? Lamb voted against it along with 181 out of a total 189 voting Democrats. How did Rothfus vote? Rothfus voted for the measure, joining all but 8 Republican voters in the House. Where does it stand? The bill passed the House and has been referred to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.",partially false
"April 3, 2020 Hon. Bill de Blasio Mayor of the City of New York City Hall New York, NY 10007 Hon. Andrew M. Cuomo Governor of New York State NYS State Capitol Building Albany, NY 12224 Re: Meeting the need for isolation space for homeless New Yorkers Dear Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo: There is an urgent humanitarian crisis among homeless New Yorkers with the spread of COVID19. There are approximately 70,000 people sleeping in DHS, HRA, DYCD, and HPD shelters each night, including 19,000 single adults sleeping in Department of Homeless Services (DHS) congregate shelters and many more individuals sleeping in other congregate shelter systems. Thousands of homeless New Yorkers are still struggling to survive on the streets while contending with a drastic reduction in access to food, hygiene supplies, bathrooms, showers, and clothing. The economic upheaval brought on by the public health crisis is already leading to increased homelessness among the scores of precariously housed New Yorkers. Homeless adults, who are at increased risk of contracting COVID-19 and experiencing severe complications, are in desperate need of private places to self-isolate. In the week ending with March 21, 2020, only 16.8 percent of all hotel rooms in New York City were occupied, leaving an 83.2-percent vacancy rate. This means there are currently more than 100,000 vacant hotel rooms that could be used to temporarily house homeless New Yorkers. Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo: The undersigned organizations urge you to immediately use this resource in order to 1.) prevent the spread of COVID-19 among an extremely vulnerable homeless population, 2.) reduce the severity of illness for homeless people in need of a private space to care for themselves but who do not require hospitalization, and 3.) help prevent overcrowding and virus spread in hospital inpatient units and emergency departments due to a lack of appropriate discharge locations for homeless individuals. In addition to the need for hotel beds, you must drastically improve access to these beds and communication among shelter providers, hospital staff, and homeless individuals. As it stands, advocates and health care providers have witnessed an array of problems accessing the alreadylimited supply of approximately 200 isolation shelter beds: Individuals have been discharged back to congregate shelters while awaiting COVID-19 test results; hospitals have been unable to reach DHS for guidance on isolation shelter placements; and multiple individuals have been denied access to isolation shelter beds because they were not recently in the DHS shelter system (including youth, unsheltered individuals, and newly homeless people). All of these scenarios are worsening an already unspeakably deadly crisis. Furthermore, although DHS has set up a procurement process for providers to operate isolation shelter beds in hotels, they have crafted the contract requirements in such an onerous way as to preclude nearly all providers from bidding. According to the procurement standards, these contracts will require their nurses to supply their own personal protective equipment (PPE), which is nearly impossible for individual providers to do because of the present severely limited supply. As of April 1st, there were 136 cases of COVID-19 reported in 74 DHS shelters, in addition to seven homeless New Yorkers testing positive while living on the streets. On April 1st, 35 homeless people were hospitalized and five deaths had been reported. Because testing and access to treatment for people with mild illness is limited, the extent of illness and death among homeless New Yorkers is likely already far more extensive than what is officially reported – and similar to the experience of other vulnerable populations living in nursing homes and jails, it is growing daily. The latest federal stimulus bill provides $4 billion in Emergency Solutions Grant (ESG) funds, and New York City is likely to receive hundreds of millions in aid as a result. ESG funds can be used to provide temporary emergency shelters such as hotels (waiving federal habitability and environmental review standards), staff costs, training, and hazard pay. Funding is available. There is no excuse not to act. All homeless individuals in congregate settings need the ability to practice safe social distancing and the City and State must provide resources to make this possible. To this end, the undersigned organizations call on Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo to immediately open thousands of hotel rooms to provide isolation for: • Every homeless individual on the streets; • All homeless individuals in shelters who are likely ill because they are experiencing symptoms or are COVID-19 positive; • All homeless persons in congregate settings who are highly vulnerable because of known or self-reported underlying health conditions, age, or other relevant conditions; and • Newly homeless individuals who require isolation because of symptoms or a positive diagnosis and who have not accessed DHS shelter in the past year or ever. We additionally call on Mayor de Blasio and the Department of Homeless Services to immediately reduce bureaucratic barriers to accessing isolation space by: • Allowing a “no wrong door” approach to accessing isolation shelters, including through outreach teams, shelter staff, or health care providers; • Relaxing requirements that staff be present at isolation hotels if necessary to open isolation beds quickly; and • Allowing congregate shelter providers and/or DHS to switch operations of individual congregate shelters to commercial hotels. Lastly, we urge Governor Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio to prioritize any staff at isolation hotels and shelters where staff or shelter residents have tested positive for COVID-19 or have COVID19-like illnesses for access to incoming supplies of PPE.

How? Because agricultural productivity would go up. Several thousand ppm in greenhouses Happer: “if you look around the world, many greenhouse operators put several thousand parts per million into their greenhouses. Host: “Would there be any negative effects on humans from breathing a trhousand parts per million? Happer: “No, absolutely not.” Our primate ancestors were here roughly 70 to 80 million years ago when CO2 levels were 3,000 parts per million. That’s when we evolved. “So it was ten times what it is now.” Happer: “We also let our sailors in submarines live in atmospheres that are several thousand parts per million.” Glacier Bay glaciers disappeared long before any increase in CO2 Happer (6:20 in): “The glaciers in Alaska’s Glacier Bay are all gone. They disappeared in the 1800s.” Happer: “In fact, that was one of the most famous trips of John Muir. Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club, was visiting Glacier Bay in 1879, and he pointed out all the glaciers were gone.

"Where Will Austin Go For Water Next? By Terrence Henry Email  Tweet    REUTERS /JULIA ROBINSON /LANDOV  The Highland Lakes, the main reservoirs for over a million people in and around Austin, are only a third full. They could reach their lowest levels in history this summer.  As the shores of those lakes receded during the Texas drought, businesses dried up and water quality declined. If you take a trip out to Lake Travis today, you’ll notice the most popular shorebird is the vulture. With the lake 46 feet below where it should be, there’s plenty of shoreline for them.  If the main water supply of a million people is at risk, what’s the ‘Plan B?’  “Unfortunately, there is no ‘Plan B,'” says state Sen. Troy Fraser R-Horseshoe Bay. “We are totally dependent on Mother Nature in this area. It’s really a problem.”  But it’s a problem that finally seems to have gotten the attention of Austin’s city leaders.  Photo by Filipa Rodrigues/StateImpact Texas  The city’s main strategy to deal with the drought up until now has been conservation, and Austinites have answered the call. Per capita, the city is using less water than ever, according to Greg Meszaros, Director of Austin Water.  But rain continues to miss the lakes. Massive releases of water to rice farmers downstream that greatly reduced lake levels in 2011, the single driest year in Central Texas history, didn’t help either.  “Comparison-wise, about three years worth of Austin’s water use” was sent to rice farmers that year, Meszaros says.  Another silent straw is sucking up water from the lakes: evaporation.The lakes lose almost as much water to evaporation as the city uses every year. Now the city is starting to think about how to extend a shrinking supply.  Courtesy of CERES  Leading part of that effort is Sharlene Leurig, Director of the Sustainable Water Infrastructure Program at Ceres, a non-profit specializing in sustainability. Leurig is chairing a new water resource task force under the direction of Austin’s City Council. Their aim is to find solutions that could boost Austin’s water supply.  “There’s no single project that will solve the challenge before us,” Leurig says. But there are a number of projects and tweaks that could significantly improve the situation. Forget big reservoirs: Austin is looking to get creative in finding more water.  Some of the solutions, Leurig says, are sitting right under Austin’s nose. Standing on the shores of Lady Bird Lake in downtown Austin, surrounded by joggers and gazing out onto the dog park at Auditorium Shores, Leurig says the pass-through lake is more than just an aesthetic treat for Austinites.  Related Topics What Is The Lower Colorado River Authority?  “Use this as a storage supply,” she says. “That might actually accept treated wastewater produced by the city of Austin for reinjection back into our drinking water system.”  Once treated, Leurig says, the water would be purer than bottled water. Several other cities in Texas, including Wichita Falls, Brownwood and San Angelo are moving forward with or considering wastewater reuse programs.  It’s just one of the many smaller solutions on the Austin water supply smorgasbord, Meszaros of Austin Water says.  “For example, what’s called Walter E. Long Lake, or Decker Lake [in East Austin], there’s no technical reason you couldn’t use that lake as a complement to the water supply,” Meszaros says.  Other ideas on tap? Here are a few being considered by the water resource task force:  Fixing Longhorn dam to better control water flows.  Lowering Lake Austin to catch more rainfall.  Using aquifers underground to store water and prevent evaporation. Meszaros of Austin Water says the city would work to use land it could easily access in order to avoid potentially costly litigation.  Rainwater capture, distributed throughout the city, especially on commercial buildings downtown.  Using a biodegradable powder on the surface of lakes in Austin’s water supply to lower evaporation, starting with smaller lakes like Lady Bird Lake or Walter E. Long Lake.  Securing groundwater access from the Carrizo-Wilcox or Northern Edwards aquifers.  There’s no “silver bullet,” Meszaros says. “There’s no golden barrel of water out there that is vastly available and very low cost. If it were, people would have it already.”  Meszaros estimates that the right mix of projects could add roughly a quarter to nearly three-quarters of Austin’s annual water use from the Highland Lakes.  Leurig of the Water Resource Planning Task Force says the answer to strengthening Austin’s water supply is likely an “all of the above” strategy.  Such a hodge-podge of projects — even small ones — will take time and money. Some are costlier than others like aquifer storage and recovery, and how the city will prioritize and budget the projects remains to be seen. Austin Water is already preparing rate increases to make up for lost revenues during the drought.  Texas Tribune  “The unfortunate thing is, it doesn’t happen overnight,” says state Sen. Fraser.  “We’re about to go through a very hot, difficult summer that I’m very nervous about. Because this event we’re going through was preventable.”  The water resource task force has until June 20th to provide their recommendations to city council. What the council will decide to do then is an open question.  And the region’s water plan is undergoing changes that will likely result in far less water going to rice farmers during dry times. Meszaros of Austin Water says regardless, Austin will continue to rely on the Colorado system.  “The lakes aren’t going to run out of water in any immediate future,” he says. “But we’re gonna be in a potentially long-term situation where they’ll be at relatively low levels compared to their historic norms. Fundamentally, we’re going to be a Colorado River system water supply-driven community for many, many decades to come.”",TRUE
"“There is a plot to discredit the President and destabilize his government,” a highly placed source in the Office of the President said. “There’s an obvious pattern of close coordination among some media organizations for the timely publication of anti-Duterte stories,” the source told this writer. The playbook is all too familiar: Utilize the media, plant fake news, distribute them to the friendly media outlets, whet the people’s appetite, arouse their anger, manipulate public emotion, touch base with the Leftist organization, enlist the support of the police and the military, then go for the “kill.” That’s how coups are staged. Except that in this instance, there is no discernible support from the police and the military, much less the people. For a coup to succeed, it is critical to have the support of the people. Unfortunately for coup plotters in this country, the people have grown tired and weary of coups. More importantly, various polls have shown that President Rodrigo Duterte still enjoys the overwhelming support of the masses. His ratings have remained in the stratospheric levels for the past three years despite the incessant attacks by the opposition. The Matrix A document provided to The Manila Times over the weekend by the same source shows what appears to be a coordinated media campaign to discredit the President. Under the heading, “Association Matrix Between BIKOY and ELLEN TORDESILLAS,” (all caps supplied), the matrix illustrates the flow of news from the source to a nexus or distributor and finally to the individual journalists for publication. It also names the journalists and organizations involved in the alleged plot to blacken the image of the President. “A group sympathetic to the President and deeply involved in the IT business had tracked the flow of information from its source to its various media assets and decided to provide the information to the President out of concern,” the source said. Media participants in the Oust-Duterte move “Bikoy,” obviously a pseudonym, was the source of the black propaganda, the matrix shows. From Bikoy, the stories go to Ellen Tordesillas, president of Vera Files, who acts as the nexus and distributor of the materials to the Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism (PCIJ), Rappler and the National Union of People’s Lawyers (NUPL). These organizations, in turn, distribute the false narratives to their respective members. (Please refer to the matrix.) Tordesillas also currently serves as a fact-checker for Facebook. The matrix, however, did not disclose the real identity of Bikoy. Save for the NUPL, a leftist group, the rest of the people from Rappler, Vera Files and the PCIJ named in the matrix are members of the media. It would now appear that these journalists are collaborating with the Left in their effort to destabilize the government, the matrix shows. “Wala namang tao na ganoon (referring to Bikoy),” the source said. The series of invented stories against the President was part of the black propaganda campaign by the Yellows, the source added. The opposition couldn’t accept that the ratings of the President remain stratospheric. “Mataas ang credibility ni Presidente.” They could not believe that despite the series of black propaganda campaign against the President, his popularity and trust ratings remain unaffected. Vera Files, the PCIJ and Rappler received largesse from various foreign sources, the source said, without specifying a figure. Plotters desperate Two other independent sources confirmed that there is an active plot to oust the President. It was obvious, they said. For one thing, it is not the duty of the press or the media to be at the forefront of an active campaign to unseat a duly elected President. The role of the press is to inform the public and expose the shenanigans, venalities and corruption in government; but certainly not to participate in any manner or form in any campaign to destabilize the government. The media is supposed to be the purveyors of truth, not an instrument to plot against a sitting President, they added. They said it became particularly vicious when Bikoy in his second video episode of the “Ang Totoong Narcolist” series, accused the President’s 14-year old daughter, Veronica and his partner, Honeylet, of receiving “payoffs from the illegal drug trade and depositing such transactions in banks in Hong Kong.” “Paano nangyari na ‘yung batang edad 14, may gatas pa sa labi, ay tumatanggap na ng suhol sa mga drug lords? Pati ‘yung kanyang ina na nananahimik sa Davao, isinangkot? Laking kabulastugan n’yan,” one of them said, to which the other agreed. Another tall tale was when Bikoy accused erstwhile presidential assistant Christopher Lawrence “Bong” Go of receiving kickbacks from the drug lords; that his takes were deposited in four local banks; and that his foreign bank transactions had reached P3.7 billion from 2010 to 2018. The accuser did not offer any shadow of proof to back up his accusations. Bikoy also accused Go of having a dragon tattoo on his back that embedded a code name for alleged drug transactions. Bikoy and his partners in crime went silent after Go bared his back to the public that showed no dragon tattoo. “Ang kinis ng likod ni Bong Go,” an amused observer said. Paid hacks in media Another media practitioner sees malice and ill intent on the part of Ellen Tordesillas when she acted as distributor of the anti-Duterte stories, as the matrix shows. “Normally, a journalist would not share her story with other journalists or media outlets, especially if it is an enterprise or exclusive story. He or she would naturally want to have a scoop.” If it is true that Ellen participated in the distribution of the story — whether that is legitimate or otherwise — at the very least, she will be guilty of unethical practice. And if she was paid for doing so, then she would be nothing more than a paid hack, a cheap propagandist, and therefore, fair game for the administration, he said. The same is true in the case of Vera Files, Rappler and the PCIJ. They appear to have received massive foreign funding, which is against our Constitution, and, therefore, these media outfits cannot claim objectivity. Their critical Duterte stories become suspect. To this date, they have not refuted allegations of foreign funding by our eminent writer, former ambassador Rigoberto Tiglao, in amounts that he said have ranged from $106,000 to $278,000. Tordesillas has been asked to comment on the allegations against her before publication of this article, but the Times has not received a reply by deadline on Sunday.",FALSE
"Under a Treaty signed in late 2019 with Canada, the People's Liberation Army of China has been quietly massing military troops in Canada since the beginning of 2020 and those troops are believed to be readying for an actual military invasion of the United States.  While it has long been rumored that China began massing troops and armor in southern Mexico for a similar invasion goal, word of such troops appearing in Canada only began this year. Those rumors were pretty much laughed off until video emerged this week of Chinese troops on a back road of Salt Spring Island, near Vancouver, British Columbia.  Here is that 35 second video:  Once actual proof emerged of Chinese troops in Canada, we started digging into where they were in relation to US soil and how such a thing could be; given that Canada was _supposed_ to be a U.S. ally?   The map below shows where China is massing the troops in Prince Rupert and on Salt Spring Island, BC, CANADA:  It turns out that the globalist/Commie Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau, signed a Treaty with China in late 2019.  In January, 2020, the Canadian Independent Press Review reported it as follows:  Under the terms of the Foreign Investment Protection Act FIPA, a bi-lateral treaty ratified with China by the Trudeau government in 2019, Chinese security forces can be stationed on Canadian soil to protect vital Chinese investments, without the knowledge or consent of local authorities.                    – Canadian Independent Press Review, January 15, 2020  One has to ask why Prime Minister Trudeau would sign such a treaty?  Does Canada not have its own military to protect vital Chinese investments?   Does Canada not trust its own Royal Canadian Mounted Police?  Are Canada's Provincial Police forces somehow inadequate?  Or did Prime Minister Trudeau somehow find that allowing China to mass troops in his country might be beneficial to HIMSELF?  Did Trudeau get a massive payoff from China to betray the United States like this?  What other explanation could there be?  According to locals in British Columbia, PLA troops are troops being stationed in Stanley Park almost an entire island of a park in Vancouver, as temporary housing until they are assigned something permanent.  Look at the size of this park:  Oh, and get this . . .Canadians say THEY CANNOT GO INTO THAT PARK because it is taken over by China's People's Liberation Army!   Anyone trying to enter the park is stopped by Vancouver police and refused entry unless they are PLA troops!  One Canadian tells me “You got ‘em PLA Troops all over the coast, man, based outta Prince Rupert. A bunch of their military intel people work outta their consulate in town Vancouver and they can airlift the assault troops here in an hour, is what I been told.”  That same source went on to say That’s how that fucking traitor Trudeau’s arranged it with Beijing, man. The west coast is theirs. They’re gonna be the ones managing the curfews and all the other shit that’s gonna follow.   So, ladies and gentlemen, our neighbor and ally, Canada, under the completely fraudulent guise of protecting Chinese investments, has betrayed the United States and is permitting China to mass troops on Canada's west coast, and China is doing so - allegedly to protect their investments - but in actual fact, for use in attacking and conquering the United States.     REDEPLOYMENT OF F-22's AND F-35's to . . .  Alaska  There was a curious story a few weeks ago about how the US is redeploying F-22's and F-35's to . . . Alaska. Story Here   It didn't make any sense at the time.  Why would we put some of our most advanced fighter jets all the way up there?   Now, we seem to know!   The US Government knows what China is doing and our government is preparing to fight them off!  Those planes can fly in from behind the Chinese troops and bomb them.     CALL-UP of ONE MILLION RESERVISTS  There was another story back in March, by ABC News HERE about President Trump authorizing the Secretary of Defense to Call-up a MILLION U.S. Military Reservists.  At the time, we were told that the call-up had to do with COVID-19 and those troops would be able to help with the outbreak.     That story just didn't hold water because the COVID outbreak wasn't nearly that bad.  Now, the call-up seems to make sense.  The US Government saw that China has begun massing troops and is calling-up a MILLION U.S. Military Reservists to fight them off!     West Coast Wild Fires to chase population away?  For months, the US west coast has been seeing ferocious wildfires that have burned millions of acres, and destroyed tens-of-thousands of homes.  Just two weeks ago, earthquake guru Dutch Since accidentally stumbled upon what appear to be Directed Energy Weapons being used to start and spread those fires!  His video showed that US Satellites in space which monitor environmental conditions in the USA, picked up literal beams in the Near-infra-red spectrum, being fired at and into the wildfires.   Here's a screen shot of such beams being fired:  When those beams hit, the fires immediately grew in intensity, and spread.  Other photos - VERY MANY - have been taken by citizens on the scenes as these beams were fired and they were so shocked at seeing it, the people too photos of the beams as they took place:  Here's a slew of others: Click image to enlarge  Then, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper, revealed to the American people that China and Russia have weaponized space and he specifically mentioned Directed Energy Weapons in his address to an Air Force conference.  In just the first TWO MINUTES, the Secretary of Defense repeatedly tells us that China and Russia are employing Asymmetric capabilities and he flatly states they have weaponized space with Directed Energy Weapons.  Just watch the first two minutes:  I'm sure all of you at some time or another have seen a car fire.   They get to burning pretty ferociously, right?  When have you EVER seen a car fire that causes the wheels to actually melt?  Take a look at what's been happening in the US west coast . . .  Vehicles are being MELTED in the so-called wild fires.  How can burning wood melt steel?  It can't.  The burn temperature doesn't get hot enough.   But a directed energy weapon could do it . . . and now, it looks as though that's precisely what's been happening!  But why?  Why would China want to start massive fires on our west coast?  Simple: To chase the people out.  The world knows that American citizens are ARMED to the teeth thanks to our Constitution's Second Amendment.  Famously, back in World War 2 after their attack upon Pearl Harbor, a Japanese General remarked that Americans were so heavily armed that Japan would face a gun behind every blade of grass if they ever tried to invade.  That, he said, was why Japan never invaded.  China knows this too.  So they're burning us out!   They're starting these fires to get rid of literally millions of Americans so Chinese troops WON'T face a gun behind every blade of grass.   These fires are softening-up the west coast for invasion!     UPDATE 10:12 PM EDT --  HEADS UP! DURING THIS MORNINGS INTERVIEW WITH MARIA BARTIROMO, PRESDENT TRUMP SAID... I HAVE BEEN BRINGING ALL OUR TROOPS HOME, WE NEED TO HAVE OUR TROOPS HOME FOR RUSSIA AND CHINA.     Why isn't Congress doing anything to defend us?  Where is a Declaration of war?   We've been under attack by directed energy weapons for months. It's time to attack back.  Americans are URGED to arm themselves and prepare.  Invading foreign army persons are to be shown NO QUARTER and NO MERCY.  Take no prisoners.   This is going to be a fight for our very existence.      SURVEIL THEM!  Canadians in British Columbia are encouraged to engage in ACTIVE, OPEN, DELIBERATE, SURVEILLANCE of Chinese Troops.  Take photos.  Take videos.  Go to Stanley Park and fly drones over it to grab video.  Go to Salt Spring Island and do the same.  Remember, there is no expectation of privacy for anything which is out in public.  No law exists preventing the surveillance of foreign military troops in public.  Either publish your videos to Youtube or to Brighteon where they won't get censored and send them to me at: Hal.Turner@HalTurnerRadioShow.com.  These troops need to be tracked and monitored.  Their locations must be determined and kept under watchful eye.  If military EQUIPMENT such as Tanks, Armored personnel carriers, self-propelled artillery, helicopters, or planes of any type are found, grab images and video of those too.

"He was not speaking about heaven or where we or they will go, he said, and this is the most important thing which was overlooked by many, that as far as Russia’s doctrine is concerned, Russia reserves no right to preemptive strike. It other words, our doctrine provides for no right to preemptive strike, Peskov stressed, adding that Russia reserves the right to a nuclear strike only in case it is attacked with the use of nuclear weapons or attacked in a way that jeopardizes the mere existence of the state. It means we will never be the first to attack anyone. This is what the president said. But if we come under attack, then everyone will go where he or she should - either to heaven or to hell, or elsewhere. This is what he meant, the rest was allegory, he said.

"This really should be one of the biggest public health scandals of the decade, but instead it’s given little attention – mainly because of the high-profile nature of the people and organisations involved. *** The United Nations has been forced to admit that a major international vaccine initiative is actually causing a deadly outbreak of the very disease it was supposed to wipe-out. While international organisations like the World Health Organization WHO will regularly boast about ‘eradicating polio’ with vaccines—the opposite seems to be the case, with vaccines causing the deaths of scores of young people living in Africa. Health officials have now admitted that their plan to stop ‘wild’ polio is backfiring, as scores children are being paralyzed by a deadly strain of the pathogen derived from a live vaccine – causing a virulent wave of polio to spread. This latest pharma-induced pandemic started out in the African countries of Chad and Sudan, with the culprit identified as vaccine-derived polio virus type 2. Officials now fear this new dangerous strain could soon ‘jump continents,’ causing further deadly outbreaks around the world. Shocking as it sounds, this Big Pharma debacle is not new. After spending some $16 billion over 30 years to eradicate polio, international health bodies have ‘accidentally’ reintroduced the disease to in Pakistan, Afghanistan, and also Iran, as the central Asia region was hit by a virulent strain of polio spawned by the a pharmaceutical vaccine. Also, in 2019, the government of Ethiopia ordered the destruction of 57,000 vials of type 2 oral polio vaccine mOPV2 following a similar outbreak of vaccine-induced polio. The same incident has happened in India as well. It’s important to note that the oral polio vaccine is being pushed by the Global Polio Eradication Initiative GPEI, a consortium which is supported and funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. All of this should be cause for concern, especially with western governments and transnational pharmaceutical giants all rushing to roll-out their new Gates-funded experimental coronavirus vaccine for the global population. Currently, the first experimental COVID-19 vaccine is being tested on the African populationthrough GAVI Vaccine Alliance, another organization funded by the Gates Foundation. A large round of human trials is taking place in South Africa, run by the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg—another Gates-funded institution. This latest revelation from Africa should prompt journalists and health advocates to ask harder questions about the efficacy and safety of the much-hype COVID ‘miracle’ vaccine. AP News reports… LONDON AP — The World Health Organization says a new polio outbreak in Sudan is linked to an ongoing vaccine-sparked epidemic in Chad — a week after the U.N. health agency declared the African continent free of the wild polio virus. In a statement this week, WHO said two children in Sudan — one from South Darfur state and the other from Gedarif state, close to the border with Ethiopia and Eritrea — were paralyzed in March and April. Both had been recently vaccinated against polio. WHO said initial outbreak investigations show the cases are linked to an ongoing vaccine-derived outbreak in Chad that was first detected last year and is now spreading in Chad and Cameroon. “There is local circulation in Sudan and continued sharing of transmission with Chad,” the U.N. agency said, adding that genetic sequencing confirmed numerous introductions of the virus into Sudan from Chad. WHO said it had found 11 additional vaccine-derived polio cases in Sudan and that the virus had also been identified in environmental samples. There are typically many more unreported cases for every confirmed polio patient. The highly infectious disease can spread quickly in contaminated water and most often strikes children under 5. In rare instances, the live polio virus in the oral vaccine can mutate into a form capable of sparking new outbreaks. Last week, WHO and partners declared that the African continent was free of the wild polio virus, calling it “an incredible and emotional day.” On Monday, WHO warned that the risk of further spread of the vaccine-derived polio across central Africa and the Horn of Africa was “high,” noting the large-scale population movements in the region. More than a dozen African countries are currently battling outbreaks of polio caused by the virus, including Angola, Congo, Nigeria and Zambia. Amid the coronavirus pandemic, many of the large-scale vaccination campaigns needed to stamp out polio have been disrupted across Africa and elsewhere, leaving millions of children vulnerable to infection. In April, WHO and its partners reluctantly recommended a temporary halt to mass polio immunization campaigns, recognizing the move could lead to a resurgence of the disease. In May, they reported that 46 campaigns to vaccinate children against polio had been suspended in 38 countries, mostly in Africa, because of the coronavirus pandemic. Some of the campaigns have recently been re-started, but health workers need to vaccinate more than 90% of children in their efforts to eradicate the paralytic disease. Health officials had initially aimed to wipe out polio by 2000, a deadline repeatedly pushed back and missed. Wild polio remains endemic in Afghanistan and Pakistan; both countries also are struggling to contain outbreaks of vaccine-derived polio. * Note to readers: please click the share buttons above or below.

"Today the Education Policy Institute's Independent Mental Health Commission publishes its final report. This is the culmination of a year's research to understand and explore progress and challenges in the transformation of children and young people's mental health care. One in 10 children aged between five and 16 have a mental health problem. That's the equivalent of three in every classroom. Yet children's mental health has always been known as the 'Cinderella of the Cinderella of the NHS', receiving just 0.7% of the total NHS budget, or about 6% of overall spending on mental health. The Mental Health Commission found that services are, on average, turning away 23%, or nearly one in four, of the children and young people referred to them for treatment by their GPs or teachers. It also identified a postcode lottery of waiting times, with wide variation in average waiting times for different providers, from two weeks in Cheshire to 19 weeks in North Staffordshire. The average wait was two months to treatment, but that conceals hidden waits of ten months or more. In March 2015, the government published a strategy, Future in Mind, which aimed to transform children's mental health services, alongside announced investment of £1.25billion over the next five years. The Education Policy Institute has analysed progress in delivering this strategy since then. Every area was asked to develop a 'local transformation plan' as a condition of receiving their share of the funding. The EPI analysis of the plans found wide variation in the quality of plans across local areas. Of the 121 published plans, only 18 areas 15% had 'good' plans. 58 plans 48% 'required improvement' and 45 plans 37% 'required substantial improvement'. The Education Policy Institute also identified significant barriers to the delivery of the strategy. For example, providers are struggling to recruit staff to fill essential posts. Eight out of 10 trusts, 83%, which responded to an Education Policy Institute Freedom of Information request stated that they had experienced recruitment difficulties. The same proportion had had to advertise posts on multiple occasions to fill roles. Mental health nurses were the most difficult profession to recruit, followed by consultant psychiatrists. These recruitment challenges had led to an 82% increase in expenditure on temporary staffing in the last two years. In 2015-16 nearly £50million was spent on agency staff by 32 trusts, up from £27million in 2013-14. Moreover, not all of the investment reaching frontline services. Only £143million of an expected £250million was released in the first year, and of that only £75million was distributed to clinical commissioning groups local health leaders. It is not yet clear how much of this has been spent on frontline services, but reports from mental health providers indicate that they have not yet seen this increased investment. For 2016-17, £119million has been allocated to clinical commissioning groups, but this has been included in their general budget, so there is a risk that it will be spent on other priorities. It is also important to consider this additional investment in the wider context of funding for the whole system. Cuts to local authority early intervention services will have an impact on child and adolescent mental health because these specialist NHS services are part of a wider system which includes local authority funded early intervention support. When those services are cut, the referrals to specialist services increase. The Care Quality Commission has found that reductions in funding, including to non-NHS services, have contributed to increased waiting times. The Commission is therefore calling for a new Prime Minister's Challenge on children and young people's mental health. Based on David Cameron's Dementia Challenge, this would cover research and prevention, early intervention, and increasing access to high quality services. On research and prevention, the Commission's recommendations include the establishment of a new Research Institute to fund research into understanding mental health. It also calls for a strategy to empower young people to live safe digital lives. On early-intervention, the Commission recommends a national programme on mental health and wellbeing within schools. This would include training for teachers and mental health featuring on the school curriculum as part of updated, statutory PSHE lessons. To increase access to high quality care, the Commission urges the government to withhold funding for those areas who cannot demonstrate that they have robust plans to improve services. They should also have to provide evidence that they are investing all the additional funding in children's mental health and not offsetting cuts elsewhere. The Commission also calls for a new national waiting time standard: that no one should wait more than eight weeks for treatment. Mental health problems can seriously affect young people's life chances, holding them back in their education and increasing their risk of ill health and unemployment in adulthood. The government has rightly prioritised improving access to care. The Commission's recommendations aim to ensure that this issue remains at the top of the policy agenda over the next five years and beyond.

"Historians may look to 2015 as the year when shit really started hitting the fan. Some snapshots: In just the past few months, record-setting heat waves in Pakistan and India each killed more than 1,000 people. In Washington state’s Olympic National Park, the rainforest caught fire for the first time in living memory. London reached 98 degrees Fahrenheit during the hottest July day ever recorded in the U.K.; The Guardian briefly had to pause its live blog of the heat wave because its computer servers overheated. In California, suffering from its worst drought in a millennium, a 50-acre brush fire swelled seventyfold in a matter of hours, jumping across the I-15 freeway during rush-hour traffic. Then, a few days later, the region was pounded by intense, virtually unheard-of summer rains. Puerto Rico is under its strictest water rationing in history as a monster El Niño forms in the tropical Pacific Ocean, shifting weather patterns worldwide. On July 20th, James Hansen, the former NASA climatologist who brought climate change to the public’s attention in the summer of 1988, issued a bombshell: He and a team of climate scientists had identified a newly important feedback mechanism off the coast of Antarctica that suggests mean sea levels could rise 10 times faster than previously predicted: 10 feet by 2065. The authors included this chilling warning: If emissions aren’t cut, “We conclude that multi-meter sea-level rise would become practically unavoidable. Social disruption and economic consequences of such large sea-level rise could be devastating. It is not difficult to imagine that conflicts arising from forced migrations and economic collapse might make the planet ungovernable, threatening the fabric of civilization.” Eric Rignot, a climate scientist at NASA and the University of California-Irvine and a co-author on Hansen’s study, said their new research doesn’t necessarily change the worst-case scenario on sea-level rise, it just makes it much more pressing to think about and discuss, especially among world leaders. In particular, says Rignot, the new research shows a two-degree Celsius rise in global temperature — the previously agreed upon “safe” level of climate change — “would be a catastrophe for sea-level rise.” Hansen’s new study also shows how complicated and unpredictable climate change can be. Even as global ocean temperatures rise to their highest levels in recorded history, some parts of the ocean, near where ice is melting exceptionally fast, are actually cooling, slowing ocean circulation currents and sending weather patterns into a frenzy. Sure enough, a persistently cold patch of ocean is starting to show up just south of Greenland, exactly where previous experimental predictions of a sudden surge of freshwater from melting ice expected it to be. Michael Mann, another prominent climate scientist, recently said of the unexpectedly sudden Atlantic slowdown, “This is yet another example of where observations suggest that climate model predictions may be too conservative when it comes to the pace at which certain aspects of climate change are proceeding.” Since storm systems and jet streams in the United States and Europe partially draw their energy from the difference in ocean temperatures, the implication of one patch of ocean cooling while the rest of the ocean warms is profound. Storms will get stronger, and sea-level rise will accelerate. Scientists like Hansen only expect extreme weather to get worse in the years to come, though Mann said it was still “unclear” whether recent severe winters on the East Coast are connected to the phenomenon. And yet, these aren’t even the most disturbing changes happening to the Earth’s biosphere that climate scientists are discovering this year. For that, you have to look not at the rising sea levels but to what is actually happening within the oceans themselves. Water temperatures this year in the North Pacific have never been this high for this long over such a large area — and it is already having a profound effect on marine life. Related: Apocalypse Soon: 9 Terrifying Signs of Environmental Doom Eighty-year-old Roger Thomas runs whale-watching trips out of San Francisco. On an excursion earlier this year, Thomas spotted 25 humpbacks and three blue whales. During a survey on July 4th, federal officials spotted 115 whales in a single hour near the Farallon Islands — enough to issue a boating warning. Humpbacks are occasionally seen offshore in California, but rarely so close to the coast or in such numbers. Why are they coming so close to shore? Exceptionally warm water has concentrated the krill and anchovies they feed on into a narrow band of relatively cool coastal water. The whales are having a heyday. “It’s unbelievable,” Thomas told a local paper. “Whales are all over the place.” Last fall, in northern Alaska, in the same part of the Arctic where Shell is planning to drill for oil, federal scientists discovered 35,000 walruses congregating on a single beach. It was the largest-ever documented “haul out” of walruses, and a sign that sea ice, their favored habitat, is becoming harder and harder to find. Marine life is moving north, adapting in real time to the warming ocean. Great white sharks have been sighted breeding near Monterey Bay, California, the farthest north that’s ever been known to occur. A blue marlin was caught last summer near Catalina Island — 1,000 miles north of its typical range. Across California, there have been sightings of non-native animals moving north, such as Mexican red crabs. No species may be as uniquely endangered as the one most associated with the Pacific Northwest, the salmon. Every two weeks, Bill Peterson, an oceanographer and senior scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Northwest Fisheries Science Center in Oregon, takes to the sea to collect data he uses to forecast the return of salmon. What he’s been seeing this year is deeply troubling. Salmon are crucial to their coastal ecosystem like perhaps few other species on the planet. A significant portion of the nitrogen in West Coast forests has been traced back to salmon, which can travel hundreds of miles upstream to lay their eggs. The largest trees on Earth simply wouldn’t exist without salmon. But their situation is precarious. This year, officials in California are bringing salmon downstream in convoys of trucks, because river levels are too low and the temperatures too warm for them to have a reasonable chance of surviving. One species, the winter-run Chinook salmon, is at a particularly increased risk of decline in the next few years, should the warm water persist offshore. “You talk to fishermen, and they all say: ‘We’ve never seen anything like this before,’ ” says Peterson. “So when you have no experience with something like this, it gets like, ‘What the hell’s going on?’ “ Atmospheric scientists increasingly believe that the exceptionally warm waters over the past months are the early indications of a phase shift in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation, a cyclical warming of the North Pacific that happens a few times each century. Positive phases of the PDO have been known to last for 15 to 20 years, during which global warming can increase at double the rate as during negative phases of the PDO. It also makes big El Niños, like this year’s, more likely. The nature of PDO phase shifts is unpredictable — climate scientists simply haven’t yet figured out precisely what’s behind them and why they happen when they do. It’s not a permanent change — the ocean’s temperature will likely drop from these record highs, at least temporarily, some time over the next few years — but the impact on marine species will be lasting, and scientists have pointed to the PDO as a global-warming preview. “The climate [change] models predict this gentle, slow increase in temperature,” says Peterson, “but the main problem we’ve had for the last few years is the variability is so high. As scientists, we can’t keep up with it, and neither can the animals.” Peterson likens it to a boxer getting pummeled round after round: “At some point, you knock them down, and the fight is over.” Attendant with this weird wildlife behavior is a stunning drop in the number of plankton — the basis of the ocean’s food chain. In July, another major study concluded that acidifying oceans are likely to have a “quite traumatic” impact on plankton diversity, with some species dying out while others flourish. As the oceans absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, it’s converted into carbonic acid — and the pH of seawater declines. According to lead author Stephanie Dutkiewicz of MIT, that trend means “the whole food chain is going to be different.” The Hansen study may have gotten more attention, but the Dutkiewicz study, and others like it, could have even more dire implications for our future. The rapid changes Dutkiewicz and her colleagues are observing have shocked some of their fellow scientists into thinking that yes, actually, we’re heading toward the worst-case scenario. Unlike a prediction of massive sea-level rise just decades away, the warming and acidifying oceans represent a problem that seems to have kick-started a mass extinction on the same time scale. Jacquelyn Gill is a paleoecologist at the University of Maine. She knows a lot about extinction, and her work is more relevant than ever. Essentially, she’s trying to save the species that are alive right now by learning more about what killed off the ones that aren’t. The ancient data she studies shows “really compelling evidence that there can be events of abrupt climate change that can happen well within human life spans. We’re talking less than a decade.” For the past year or two, a persistent change in winds over the North Pacific has given rise to what meteorologists and oceanographers are calling “the blob” — a highly anomalous patch of warm water between Hawaii, Alaska and Baja California that’s thrown the marine ecosystem into a tailspin. Amid warmer temperatures, plankton numbers have plummeted, and the myriad species that depend on them have migrated or seen their own numbers dwindle. Significant northward surges of warm water have happened before, even frequently. El Niño, for example, does this on a predictable basis. But what’s happening this year appears to be something new. Some climate scientists think that the wind shift is linked to the rapid decline in Arctic sea ice over the past few years, which separate research has shown makes weather patterns more likely to get stuck. A similar shift in the behavior of the jet stream has also contributed to the California drought and severe polar vortex winters in the Northeast over the past two years. An amplified jet-stream pattern has produced an unusual doldrum off the West Coast that’s persisted for most of the past 18 months. Daniel Swain, a Stanford University meteorologist, has called it the “Ridiculously Resilient Ridge” — weather patterns just aren’t supposed to last this long. What’s increasingly uncontroversial among scientists is that in many ecosystems, the impacts of the current off-the-charts temperatures in the North Pacific will linger for years, or longer. The largest ocean on Earth, the Pacific is exhibiting cyclical variability to greater extremes than other ocean basins. While the North Pacific is currently the most dramatic area of change in the world’s oceans, it’s not alone: Globally, 2014 was a record-setting year for ocean temperatures, and 2015 is on pace to beat it soundly, boosted by the El Niño in the Pacific. Six percent of the world’s reefs could disappear before the end of the decade, perhaps permanently, thanks to warming waters. Since warmer oceans expand in volume, it’s also leading to a surge in sea-level rise. One recent study showed a slowdown in Atlantic Ocean currents, perhaps linked to glacial melt from Greenland, that caused a four-inch rise in sea levels along the Northeast coast in just two years, from 2009 to 2010. To be sure, it seems like this sudden and unpredicted surge was only temporary, but scientists who studied the surge estimated it to be a 1-in-850-year event, and it’s been blamed on accelerated beach erosion “almost as significant as some hurricane events.” Possibly worse than rising ocean temperatures is the acidification of the waters. Acidification has a direct effect on mollusks and other marine animals with hard outer bodies: A striking study last year showed that, along the West Coast, the shells of tiny snails are already dissolving, with as-yet-unknown consequences on the ecosystem. One of the study’s authors, Nina Bednaršek, told Science magazine that the snails’ shells, pitted by the acidifying ocean, resembled “cauliflower” or “sandpaper.” A similarly striking study by more than a dozen of the world’s top ocean scientists this July said that the current pace of increasing carbon emissions would force an “effectively irreversible” change on ocean ecosystems during this century. In as little as a decade, the study suggested, chemical changes will rise significantly above background levels in nearly half of the world’s oceans. “I used to think it was kind of hard to make things in the ocean go extinct,” James Barry of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute in California told the Seattle Times in 2013. “But this change we’re seeing is happening so fast it’s almost instantaneous.” Thanks to the pressure we’re putting on the planet’s ecosystem — warming, acidification and good old-fashioned pollution — the oceans are set up for several decades of rapid change. Here’s what could happen next. The combination of excessive nutrients from agricultural runoff, abnormal wind patterns and the warming oceans is already creating seasonal dead zones in coastal regions when algae blooms suck up most of the available oxygen. The appearance of low-oxygen regions has doubled in frequency every 10 years since 1960 and should continue to grow over the coming decades at an even greater rate. So far, dead zones have remained mostly close to the coasts, but in the 21st century, deep-ocean dead zones could become common. These low-oxygen regions could gradually expand in size — potentially thousands of miles across — which would force fish, whales, pretty much everything upward. If this were to occur, large sections of the temperate deep oceans would suffer should the oxygen-free layer grow so pronounced that it stratifies, pushing surface ocean warming into overdrive and hindering upwelling of cooler, nutrient-rich deeper water. Enhanced evaporation from the warmer oceans will create heavier downpours, perhaps destabilizing the root systems of forests, and accelerated runoff will pour more excess nutrients into coastal areas, further enhancing dead zones. In the past year, downpours have broken records in Long Island, Phoenix, Detroit, Baltimore, Houston and Pensacola, Florida. Evidence for the above scenario comes in large part from our best understanding of what happened 250 million years ago, during the “Great Dying,” when more than 90 percent of all oceanic species perished after a pulse of carbon dioxide and methane from land-based sources began a period of profound climate change. The conditions that triggered “Great Dying” took hundreds of thousands of years to develop. But humans have been emitting carbon dioxide at a much quicker rate, so the current mass extinction only took 100 years or so to kick-start. With all these stressors working against it, a hypoxic feedback loop could wind up destroying some of the oceans’ most species-rich ecosystems within our lifetime. A recent study by Sarah Moffitt of the University of California-Davis said it could take the ocean thousands of years to recover. “Looking forward for my kid, people in the future are not going to have the same ocean that I have today,” Moffitt said. As you might expect, having tickets to the front row of a global environmental catastrophe is taking an increasingly emotional toll on scientists, and in some cases pushing them toward advocacy. Of the two dozen or so scientists I interviewed for this piece, virtually all drifted into apocalyptic language at some point. For Simone Alin, an oceanographer focusing on ocean acidification at NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory in Seattle, the changes she’s seeing hit close to home. The Puget Sound is a natural laboratory for the coming decades of rapid change because its waters are naturally more acidified than most of the world’s marine ecosystems. The local oyster industry here is already seeing serious impacts from acidifying waters and is going to great lengths to avoid a total collapse. Alin calls oysters, which are non-native, the canary in the coal mine for the Puget Sound: “A canary is also not native to a coal mine, but that doesn’t mean it’s not a good indicator of change.” Though she works on fundamental oceanic changes every day, the Dutkiewicz study on the impending large-scale changes to plankton caught her off-guard: “This was alarming to me because if the basis of the food web changes, then . . . everything could change, right?” Alin’s frank discussion of the looming oceanic apocalypse is perhaps a product of studying unfathomable change every day. But four years ago, the birth of her twins “heightened the whole issue,” she says. “I was worried enough about these problems before having kids that I maybe wondered whether it was a good idea. Now, it just makes me feel crushed.” Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and evangelical Christian, moved from Canada to Texas with her husband, a pastor, precisely because of its vulnerability to climate change. There, she engages with the evangelical community on science — almost as a missionary would. But she’s already planning her exit strategy: “If we continue on our current pathway, Canada will be home for us long term. But the majority of people don’t have an exit strategy. . . . So that’s who I’m here trying to help.” James Hansen, the dean of climate scientists, retired from NASA in 2013 to become a climate activist. But for all the gloom of the report he just put his name to, Hansen is actually somewhat hopeful. That’s because he knows that climate change has a straightforward solution: End fossil-fuel use as quickly as possible. If tomorrow, the leaders of the United States and China would agree to a sufficiently strong, coordinated carbon tax that’s also applied to imports, the rest of the world would have no choice but to sign up. This idea has already been pitched to Congress several times, with tepid bipartisan support. Even though a carbon tax is probably a long shot, for Hansen, even the slim possibility that bold action like this might happen is enough for him to devote the rest of his life to working to achieve it. On a conference call with reporters in July, Hansen said a potential joint U.S.-China carbon tax is more important than whatever happens at the United Nations climate talks in Paris. One group Hansen is helping is Our Children’s Trust, a legal advocacy organization that’s filed a number of novel challenges on behalf of minors under the idea that climate change is a violation of intergenerational equity — children, the group argues, are lawfully entitled to inherit a healthy planet. A separate challenge to U.S. law is being brought by a former EPA scientist arguing that carbon dioxide isn’t just a pollutant (which, under the Clean Air Act, can dissipate on its own), it’s also a toxic substance. In general, these substances have exceptionally long life spans in the environment, cause an unreasonable risk, and therefore require remediation. In this case, remediation may involve planting vast numbers of trees or restoring wetlands to bury excess carbon underground. Even if these novel challenges succeed, it will take years before a bend in the curve is noticeable. But maybe that’s enough. When all feels lost, saving a few species will feel like a triumph. Odds are good that the worst wildfire disaster in U.S. history might not happen in the West – but in New Jersey. Find out why.",other
"SHARE  By of the  Republican state Rep. Jeff Stone of Greendale formally announced his bid to succeed Scott Walker as Milwaukee County executive Wednesday, saying he'd adhere closely to Walker's formula - keeping a tight lid on taxes, pushing for worker concessions and promoting job development.  Meanwhile Wednesday, Walker announced he will step down as county executive Dec. 27. That ensures that the special elections for his replacement can be held concurrent with spring elections - Feb. 15 for a primary, if needed, and April 5 for the runoff - and avoid costs of a separate election.  Serving the residents of Milwaukee County for the last eight years has been an honor, Walker said in the statement.  Stone joins what could become a crowded field, with several other legislators, county supervisors and even former county executive Tom Ament pondering a run for the remaining year of Walker's term as county executive. Stone, however, becomes the first of the higher-profile prospects to announce he'll run and is the only Republican office holder among a lengthening list of possible candidates for the nonpartisan job.  We need to look at all options to keep our county financially viable - any option except raising taxes, Stone said from his newly opened campaign office in Wauwatosa. He stressed the importance of private-sector solutions to problems in the local economy and said job creation would go a long way toward improving the county's financial condition.  Stone, 49, said he'd be a vital link for the county with Walker in the governor's office and Republicans who will run both houses of the Legislature next year. He praised Walker's tenure as county executive and noted he once carpooled to the Capitol with Walker when they served together in the Assembly.  He differs from Walker in having a background steeped in business, said Stone, who has run a printing business for 27 years. Stone said Walker's era as county executive began with a focus of reforming government, while his emphasis will be on expanding the economy.  Stone made a pitch for harmony with the County Board, which has frequently sparred with Walker. Stone also said he'd enlist the help of the local business community and others.  Though he spoke mostly in generalities, Stone said he wanted to develop a long-range plan for restoring the county to fiscal health.  His announcement drew criticism from Mike Tate, the state Democratic Party chairman, who said Stone would continue Walker policies and result in deeper financial problems. He said the party would spend thousands to help a Democratic or progressive candidate defeat Stone.  Stone said he expects to have to raise $800,000 or more to run a successful race. His campaign account now has a balance of nearly $13,000, state records show.  The lineup of potential candidates includes former Democratic state Rep. Sheldon Wasserman, County Board Chairman Lee Holloway, County Supervisors Johnny Thomas and Marina Dimitrijevic, County Clerk Joe Czarnezki, County Treasurer Dan Diliberti and Ament.  Holloway will temporarily succeed Walker as county executive but must appoint an interim executive within 30 days. Holloway has said he might appoint himself interim executive, which would mean he'd hold the office through the April 5 special election.",TRUE
"Postcards from the Great Divide is a series of nine short documentaries in nine different states examining the deeply partisan split among the American electorate. Each Postcard brings a specific political issue to life, providing an in-depth look at a specific demographic or partisan environment. Black voters in Florida hesitating to vote post-Obama; urban and rural Minnesota residents distancing themselves based on political views; Wisconsin ex-legislators ruing the intense ideological splits that have turned the once congenial state into a partisan battleground; the differing challenges of getting out the Latino vote in Texas and Nevada; GOP strategy to capture a state government in Washington and Republican dominance in the South in Kentucky; national money creating a larger partisan divide in a local election in Colorado and one activist’s mission to resurrect the Democrats in deep red Nebraska. Louis Alvarez, Andrew Kolker, and Paul Stekler executive produced the series and collaborated with six independent filmmakers to make the films, all produced in a digital partnership between PBS’ Election 2016 initiative and The Washington Post, funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and Latino Public Broadcasting, with a PBS broadcast on the World Channel. All the films are viewable at www.politicalpostcards.org. Getting Back to Abnormal is about New Orleans politics and race relations after Katrina. In the context of the city’s long history of political dysfunction and complicated race relations, the film focuses on Stacy Head, a take no prisoners white woman representing a black majority district for city council after Katrina, and her irrepressible African-American aide Barbara Lacen-Keller as they try and navigate New Orleans’ treacherous political scene in a campaign for re-election. With a cast of only-in-New-Orleans characters, and interwoven with stories about housing, culture, and history, Getting Back to Abnormal is a provocative and entertaining look at race in America, set against the backdrop of city’s most unique city. Made with his frequent collaborators Louis Alvarez, Andy Kolker and Peter Odabashian (Vote for Me: Politics in America, Louisiana Boys: Raised on Politics), the film premiered at South by Southwest in 2013 and aired nationally on PBS’s POV series in 2014. The Los Angeles Times described it as “poetry… every frame is full of life”; the New Orleans Advocate called it “raucous and brilliant”; The Boston Globe found it to be “a gritty, street-level look at a unique city”; “an entertaining portrayal of New Orleans in all its glorious dysfunction,” wrote the Austin American-Statesman; The Washington Post said, “a fabulous introduction to N’awlins-style politics”; and National Journalcalled it “a film unlike any you have ever seen before.” It's the fourth documentary that some combination of Stekler and his collaborators had broadcast on POV, one each in the last four decades. Stekler’s feature article, “Documenting New Orleans on Film,” is both a look at the history of documentary films about the Crescent City and puts Getting Back to Abnormal in context.

"New Wisconsin TV/Radio Ads Questions Ryan's Claim of a Labor Shortage  August 6, 2013 - Washington, D.C. - Beginning the week of August 5, television ads will begin running in Wisconsin taking issue with Rep. Paul Ryan's support for massive increases in immigration to the United States. The ads are being paid for by the Federation for American Immigration Reform FAIR, a national nonpartisan organization that supports enforcement of U.S. immigration laws and overall reductions in immigration to restore a fair labor market for all. The Wisconsin ad buy is over $200,000 and is the next phase of a growing seven figure ad campaign to appear around the country. FAIR has already invested nearly $1 million in radio and TV spots in the first half of 2013 alone. Similar ads will soon appear elsewhere.  The 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee has become a prominent voice in support of granting amnesty to illegal aliens and dramatically increasing future immigration to avert a looming labor shortage in the United States. The ads challenge Ryan to justify his support for massive immigration increases in light of chronically high unemployment across Wisconsin and even in his own congressional district.  Ryan's advocacy for amnesty and immigration increases has intensified as unemployment has been on the rise throughout Wisconsin. In June, unemployment increased in 30 of the state's 32 largest cities and in 56 of the state's 72 counties.

"ST. PETERSBURG Sputnik - The fact that the West has remained silent following the Russian Defense Ministry's recent release of new information about the downed flight MH17 proves the integrity of the data, Nicolas Dhuicq, a spokesman for the Debout La France France Arise party, told Sputnik on Tuesday. This article has been updated with the context information including reaction of the Dutch government, the Joint Investigation Team JIT and UK Defense Secretary. While investigators from the Joint Investigation Team JIT pledged to meticulously study the information presented by the Russian authorities as soon as it is made available to the JIT, the government officials' reactions were brief, with the Dutch government saying they had taken notice of the publications covering the Russian Defense Ministry briefing and UK Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson immediately rejecting Moscow's findings as another example of Russian disinformation. READ MORE: Russian Military Reveals Evidence Proving Ukraine's Involvement in MH17 Crash The Russian Defense Ministry on Monday presented declassified files on the Buk missile that hit flight MH17 in 2014, showing that the missile was made at Russia's Dolgoprudny Plant in 1986, delivered to a military unit in Ukraine, where it remained after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. We are unfortunately living in a propaganda era when media and the Western establishment are trying to discredit any information coming from Russia. The team that investigates the plane’s downing will be obliged to take into account this new information released by the Russian authorities but the international community will remain silent. They prefer not to speak on a topic where they were wrong. They are and will remain totally silent on a subject. Their silence proves that this information is true and credible, the official said. Dhuicq added that he, personally, had no reason to doubt the credibility of these new findings, pointing out that Russia would not have benefited from bringing down a civilian flight with 298 people on board, while Kiev in July 2014 was in despair and not fully in control of its military personnel. The organization of the Ukrainian army at that time was very hectic. There were groups that were not under the center’s [Kiev's] control. I also believe that there would be no benefit for Russia in bringing down a civilian airplane. I also always doubted that it was brought down by Donbas separatists because shooting such a missile requires some training and organization, he said. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 crashed on July 17, 2014 in eastern Ukraine, while en route to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam, leaving no survivors. Kiev and self-proclaimed republics in Ukraine’s southeast have blamed each other for the tragic incident. READ MORE: ‘Ukrainian Authorities Deliberately Sent MH17 Airliner Into Warzone' — Historian The Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team JIT concluded that the plane was brought down by a missile which came from the 53rd Anti-aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Armed Forces, based near Russia's Kursk.

"Posted: February 10, 2020 by Last updated: New online scams have preyed on the public's fear about coronavirus outbreak. Don't be fooled. Here is what we know about coronavirus and its related scams. UPDATE 03/05/2020: Yesterday, our malware intelligence researchers found a clever ploy to hide an info-stealer behind a website that purported to show updated coronavirus cases on a global map. Malwarebytes initially detected the malware, which carried the ominous and maybe-too-obvious filename “corona.exe”, as Trojan.Corona. Upon further analysis, we learned that this malware was actually a variant of AzorUlt, a family of spyware that steals information and sometimes downloads additional malware. We have now updated the detection name to Spyware.AzorUlt. Unlike similar coronavirus scams we discovered last month, this threat does not rely on an email campaign. Original story below. Panic and confusion about the recent coronavirus outbreak spurred threat actors to launch several malware campaigns across the world, relying on a tried-and-true method to infect people’s machines: fear. Cybercriminals targeted users in Japan with an Emotet campaign that included malicious Word documents that allegedly contained information about coronavirus prevention. Malware embedded into PDFs, MP4s, and Docx files circulated online, bearing titles that alluded to protection tips. Phishing emails that allegedly came from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) were spotted, too. Malwarebytes also found a novel scam purporting to direct users to a donation page to help support government and medical research. All of these threats rely on the same dangerous intersection of misinformation and panic—a classic and grotesque cybercrime tactic. A great defense to these is, quite simply, the truth. At Malwarebytes, we understand that safeguarding you from cyberthreats goes beyond technological protection. It also means giving you the information you need to make smart, safe decisions. Because of this, we’re presenting verified resources and data about coronavirus that will hopefully steer users away from online threats. If you see a sketchy-looking email mentioning the virus (like the one we found below), don’t open it. Instead, come here. If you want to immediately see what these online scams look like, scroll below. What is coronavirus? According to the World Health Organization, the current coronavirus that has infected thousands of people across the world is a single variant of a broader family of viruses, also called “coronavirus.” This particular strain of coronavirus was first identified in the city of Wuhan in central China’s Hubei province. It has the title “2019-nCoV.” Though 2019-nCoV is from the same family of coronaviruses as SARS—which spread to 26 countries between 2002 and 2003—it is not the same virus. As of February 7, coronavirus has spread to at least 25 countries, including Australia, Vietnam, the United States, the Philippines, Nepal, Sweden, the United Kingdom, India, and more. Mexico has no reported cases—the only country in North America to avoid the virus, it appears. Countries in South America, including Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Chile, have not reported any confirmed cases of the virus, either. While the majority of infections are reported in China, with 31,211 confirmed cases, the highest count of any other country is Singapore, with 30 cases. Full, daily reports on the virus’ spread can be found at the World Health Organization’s resource page here: Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) situation reports. The situation reports also provide information about every country with confirmed coronavirus cases, and this Al Jazeera article compiles that information up to February 6. According to a February 6 report in The Wall Street Journal that cites scientists and medical academics in China, the recent coronavirus likely started in bats. According to the US Center for Disease Control, coronavirus symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. How can I protect myself from coronavirus? Because coronavirus spreads from human-to-human contact, the best protection methods involve good hygiene. According to the WHO, individuals should: Wash your hands frequently with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand rub if your hands are not visibly dirty. Maintain social distancing—maintain at least 1 meter (3 feet) distance between yourself and other people, particularly those who are coughing, sneezing and have a fever. Avoid touching eyes, nose, and mouth. If you have fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, seek medical care early. Tell your health care provider if you have travelled in an area in China where 2019-nCoV has been reported, or if you have been in close contact with someone with who has travelled from China and has respiratory symptoms. If you have mild respiratory symptoms and no travel history to or within China, carefully practice basic respiratory and hand hygiene and stay home until you are recovered, if possible. The WHO also actively dispelled some current myths about coronavirus. For instance, individuals cannot catch the virus from dogs and cats that are their pets, and vaccines against pneumonia do not protect against coronavirus. For more information on coronavirus myths, please visit the WHO Myth Busters page here, along with the WHO Q&A page. What else should I know about coronavirus? Coronavirus is a serious threat, but it is not the world-ending plague that many fear. As of February 7, the virus has resulted in 637 total deaths. A February 6 notice by the Chinese media service CGTN reported more recoveries, at 1,542. Individuals should not fear receiving packages from China, the WHO said, as the virus cannot survive long durations on physical objects like packages and letters. Similarly, individuals should not dip into unmeasured fear of all things Chinese. These fears have turned New York’s Chinatown district into a “ghost town,” said one local business owner, and have fueled multiple xenophobic and racist assumptions across the world. The WHO says it is okay to receive packages delivered from China. Coronavirus has also received a strong global response. Air travel has been severely limited, Olympic qualifying games were relocated, workers built a hospital in about 10 days, fast food restaurants temporarily closed their locations, and China closed off entire populations—which has come with its own tragic tales of quarantine camps, isolation, and fear. The spread of the virus is scary, yes, but people are working day and night to prevent greater exposure. What should I know about coronavirus scams? Coronavirus online scams are largely similar to one another. By preying on misinformation and fear, cybercriminals hope to trick unwitting individuals into opening files and documents that promise information about the virus. However, Malwarebytes recently found an email scam that preys on people’s desire to help during a moment like this. The scam email—titled “URGENT: Coronavirus, Can we count on your support today?”—purportedly comes from the nondescript “Department of Health.” Inside, the email asks users to donate to coronavirus prevention causes. “We need your support , Would you consider donating 100 HKD to help us achieve our mission?” the email says near its end, before offering a disguised link that opens an application, not a website. The link itself begins with neither HTTPS or HTTP, but “HXXP.” A screenshot of an emailed coronavirus scam that preys on users’ good will. Routine scams that allegedly include information about prevention and protection also come through emails, like this phishing scam spotted by Sophos. A screenshot of the emailed coronavirus scam that Sophos discovered. The malicious email informs its recipient to open an attached document that includes information about “safety measures regarding the spreading of coronavirus,” which then directs users to a page that asks for their email address and password. These scams are becoming a dime a dozen, and we don’t expect them to dwindle any time soon. In fact, threat actors in China were spotted sending malware around through email and through the Chinese social media platform WeChat. Though the exact types of malware were not reported, the Computer Virus Emergency Response Center said the malware itself could be used to steal data or remotely control victims’ devices. Coronavirus information and data resources If you’re afraid about the spread of coronavirus, we understand. But please, do not click any links in any sketchy emails, and do not donate to any causes you have not already vetted outside of your email client.

"Study: ginger is 10,000x more effective at killing cancer than chemo it won’t destroy healthy cells!  Loading...  Ginger has been used as both food and medicine for thousands of years.  Native to southeastern Asia, ginger has been a common ingredient in these parts of the world and has long been prized for its aromatic, culinary and medicinal properties.  Loading...  This underground stem, which is used as both a spice and herb, is packed with active ingredients that play a variety of roles in your body and is still a popular remedy for motion and morning sickness.However, current research offers new hope for cancer patients.  Ginger has helped many a cancer patient fend off nausea and inflammation during treatment. Now it appears it can do even more.  Loading...  In a Georga State University study on the effects of ginger extract on living cells, researchers found that ginger extract induced growth-inhibition and death on cancerous cells, while leaving the healthy cells alone.  Ginger was found found to have virtually no side effects, which separates it from modern-day chemotherapy. Some forms of chemotherapy have actually been found to increase the rate of metastasis, causing cancer to appear in other organs that were unrelated to the organ being treated.  “Whatever manipulations we’re doing to tumors can inadvertently do something to increase the tumor numbers to become more metastatic, which is what kills patients at the end of the day,” said Dr. Raghu Kalluri, working on an unrelated study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.  At George State, the researchers found that ginger extract shrunk prostate tumors in mice by 56%, while reducing inflammation and providing anti-oxidants.  This study comes in addition to 17 other studies linking ginger to anti-cancer benefits. The plant has also been subjected to peer-reviewed studies that link it to healing when dealing with over 101 other diseases.  You can enjoy the benefits of ginger in various way, teas, extracts, supplements, and you can eat raw ginger to benefit quickly from its healing powers.  Source: Health Holistic Living",other
"There’s not much to laugh about these days, but the news that smokers might be protected from Covid-19 is certainly one of them. With study after study showing that smokers are under-represented in coronavirus wards, the renowned French neuroscientist, Jean-Pierre Changeux, is working on a randomised control trial to test the effect of nicotine patches on Covid-19 patients.  These groups are so used to lying with impunity that they wasted no time in asserting that smoking caused coronavirus complications when the pandemic began. In the US, newspapers have been filled with reports that smokers and vapers ‘may’ be at greater risk from Covid-19, a weasel word that requires no evidence. A group of doctors in New York urged governor Andrew Cuomo to ban the sale of all tobacco and e-cigarette products on the false premise that ‘mounting evidence demonstrates the link between tobacco use and increased risk for progressive Covid-19’. Meanwhile, the World Health Organisation has been taking occasional breaks from flattering the Chinese Communist Party to make evidence-free assertions about smokers being ‘likely’ to suffer more from the coronavirus.  This is far from being a crackpot theory. Changeux has explained his hypothesis at length here . In simple terms, he says that nicotinic acetylcholine receptors play a key role in the development of the disease and that nicotine can put a brake on it. If he is right – and the banter heuristic says he is – it would not only save thousands of lives but would also be one in the eye for the ‘public health’ groups who have been claiming that smoking and vaping are risk factors for Covid-19.  Three weeks ago, Public Health England fished around in the emerging literature and found a study from China involving a grand total of five smokers hospitalised with Covid-19, of whom three suffered severe symptoms. From this crumb of evidence, they made the astounding claim that ‘smokers with Covid-19 are 14 times more likely to develop severe respiratory disease’.  A few days earlier, a group of doctors from the Royal Glamorgan Hospital had written to the British Medical Journal to point out that nicotine protects against the kind of acute inflammatory reactions seen in Covid patients and that ‘the simple use of nicotine patches should be urgently considered and discussed’. Nobody paid much attention, but evidence supporting the smoking hypothesis continued to slip out.  Dr Konstantinos Farsalinos of the University of Patras in Greece noticed this phenomenon early on and put a preliminary study online in late March. It noted the ‘unusually low prevalence of current smoking was observed among hospitalised Covid-19 patients’, which ‘does not support the argument that current smoking is a risk factor for hospitalisation for Covid-19, and might suggest a protective role’.  The most comprehensive epidemiological study appeared a week later. Based on data from 4,103 Covid patients in New York City, a team of researchers found that a history of smoking was associated with a 29 per cent reduction in risk of being hospitalised with Covid-19 and, contrary to the claims of Public Health England, smokers were no more likely to become critically ill with the disease if they were admitted. The authors would have found an even sharper reduction in risk for current smokers if they had split them up from ex-smokers in their analysis, but even the findings as published were striking.  On 3 April, the US Centers for Disease Control published data on thousands of American Covid-19 cases. Once again, the proportion of smokers was tiny – just 1.3 per cent. Even ex-smokers were significantly under-represented 2.3 per cent.  This week, a group of French academics published their study of 343 Covid patients , of whom only 4.4 per cent were daily smokers. According to the authors, the study ‘strongly suggests that daily smokers have a very much lower probability of developing symptomatic or severe SARS-CoV-2 infection as compared to the general population’. This seems to have been the study that prompted Professor Changeux to go public with his research project.  Far be it from me to preempt the conclusions of the professor’s research, but let us consider for a moment the policy implications of nicotine being the only tried and tested prophylactic for Covid-19. We could issue Lucky Strikes on prescription. We could #ClapForOurCigarettes every Thursday evening. The case for closing down Public Health England would be stronger than ever. We could open the pubs, but only to smokers and vapers. We might allow a few non-smokers in to enjoy the possible benefits of passive exposure, but only if they stand two metres apart. There is everything to play for.",other

Sign up Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice NHS hospital beds numbers have plunged by 20% over the past decade and left the health service at “breaking point”, the British Medical Association warned. Analysis by the BMA found the number of overnight beds in English hospitals fell by a fifth between 2006/7 and 2015/16. BMA chairman Mark Porter said: “The UK already has the second lowest number of hospital beds per head in Europe per head ,and these figures paint an even bleaker picture of an NHS that is at breaking point. “High bed occupancy is a symptom of wider pressure and demand on an overstretched and underfunded system. It causes delays in admissions, operations being cancelled and patients being unfairly and sometimes repeatedly let down.” The BMA’s new report found that in the first week of January this year, almost three-quarters of trusts had a bed occupancy rate of 95% on at least one day. According to the analysis, in 2000 there were an average of 3.8 beds per 1,000 people, but this had dropped to 2.4 beds by 2015. Image: Universal Images Group The report said that in November 2016, 14.8% of patients spent more than four hours waiting for a hospital bed, having been seen in an A&E department. “The data demonstrates the increasing pressures on the system,” Dr Porter said. “It provides evidence of the underlying cracks within the NHS, such as funding constraints, changes and increases in demand, disjointed care and workforce pressures,” the BMA report said. It noted that pressures on mental health services were particularly acute, with a 44% decrease in the number of mental health beds since 2000/01. The document was seized on by opposition politicians, with Labour saying it was a “wake-up call which Theresa May must not ignore” and the Liberal Democrats warning the situation was becoming “intolerable”. Image: Moment RF Shadow Health Secretary Jonathan Ashworth said: “Thanks to Tory mishandling of our NHS, patient numbers in hospitals are now routinely above the levels recommended for safety. The shameful reality is this overcrowding puts patients at risk and blows apart ministers’ claims to be prioritising safety. “The number of overnight hospital beds has decreased by over a fifth, and combined with Tory neglect and underfunding this has left nine out of 10 hospitals dangerously overcrowded this winter.” Lib Dem spokesman and former health minister Norman Lamb added: “Chronic bed shortages should be the exception not the rule. “The situation is getting intolerable, with more cancelled operations, longer delays and those with mental health issues being systematically let down. “The Government is failing to properly fund the NHS and patients are paying the price.” A NHS Improvement spokeswoman said: “The NHS has been under real pressure this winter, as it copes with a surge in demand for emergency services the knock-on effects are felt throughout our hospitals. “Our hospitals are extremely busy but we are working tirelessly alongside providers to help them manage and to support more efficient use of the number of beds available.”",partially false
"MINSK, September 18. /TASS/. Kiev’s representatives have refused to sign the so-called Steinmeier formula at a meeting in Minsk on Wednesday, putting plans to hold a Normandy Four summit at risk of failure, a source familiar with talks within the Contact Group on resolving the Donbass conflict told TASS. The Contact Group’s meeting was focused on the agreements that the aides to the leaders of Russia, Germany, France and Ukraine had reached during recent consultations in Berlin, which particularly stipulated that a document on the implementation of the ‘Steinmeier formula’ be signed at today’s meeting so that the disengagement of forces may begin near the Petrovskoye and Zolotoye settlements, the source said. However, the Ukrainian delegation refused to sign the document, putting preparations for a Normandy Four summit at risk of failure, he added. In late 2015, then German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier put forward a plan that later became known as the Steinmeier formula. The plan stipulates that special status be granted to Donbass in accordance with the Minsk Agreements. In particular, the document envisages that Ukraine’s special law on local self-governance will take effect in certain areas of the Donetsk and Lugansk regions on a temporary basis on the day of local elections, becoming permanent after the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE publishes a report on the vote’s results. Center for Current Politics Director Alexei Chesnakov said earlier in an interview with TASS that a Normandy Four summit could not take place unless Kiev signed documents recognizing the Steinmeier formula..",partially false
"My daughter probably wouldn't have survived in a system where bureaucrats stifle innovation and ration care. Today is the first anniversary of the greatest single assault on our freedom in my lifetime: the signing of ObamaCare. As we consider what this law may do to our country, I can't help but reflect on a medical miracle made possible by the American health-care system. It's one that holds special meaning for me. Some years ago, a little girl was born with a serious heart defect: Her aorta and pulmonary artery were reversed. Without immediate intervention, she would not have survived. The infant was rushed to another hospital where a surgeon performed a procedure at 1 a.m. that saved her life. Eight months later, when her heart was the size of a small plum, an incredibly dedicated and skilled team of medical professionals surgically reconstructed it. Twenty-seven years later, the young woman is now a nurse in a neonatal intensive care unit where she is studying to become a nurse practitioner. She wasn't saved by a bureaucrat, and no government mandate forced her parents to purchase the coverage that saved her. Instead, her care was provided under a run-of-the-mill plan available to every employee of an Oshkosh, Wis., plastics plant. If you haven't guessed, this story touches my heart because the girl is my daughter, Carey. And my wife and I are incredibly thankful that we had the freedom to seek out the most advanced surgical technique.

Police Chief Robert Garner said that an anonymous tip was left on their drug hotline, expressing concern about a horrible burning smell that was coming from the back of the Decatur WalMart facility. When an officer was sent to investigate, the store was instantly shut down as he discovered a meth lab that took up the entire back room. “The thing was massive, and contained enough materials to make hundreds, if not thousands, of pounds of crystal meth,” said Chief Garner. “Apparently, every employee in the store was a part of it, from working with and gathering materials, to cooking, to selling it outside of the store. It was a full, massive operation.” No one from Walmart’s corporate office was available for comment, but an unofficial spokesperson did say that they were “disappointed” that they weren’t able to use their company discount to get meth before the place was shut down. 0 Comments comments",FALSE
"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump deserves credit for forcing all 17 Republican candidates to talk about the social costs of illegal immigration, but it is not “Trump’s issue.” We will be making a fatal mistake if we let the media discuss it that way.  As Ann Coulter has pointed out, this is the most critical issue of the 2016 race because this is the issue that will define whether or not there will even be an American nation recognizable as the “home of the free and land of the brave.”  But illegal immigration is not “Ann Coulter’s issue” any more than it is “Tom Tancredo’s issue.” It is America’s issue — not only because it will define America in the 21st Century but because it also defines American elections and who will be voting in elections in 2020 and beyond. It also illuminates the power of the mainstream media to keep issues off the national stage.  Think of illegal immigration this way: If the liberal media can keep illegal alien crime out of the “kitchen table debate,” they can keep any issue out of the debate. And they will if they can get away with it. For those reasons, illegal immigration is much more than an issue of public policy; it is the poster child for media malpractice.  The media’s attempt to suppress public awareness over illegal alien crime and the effects of illegal immigration on American workers’ jobs and wages is nothing less than censorship on a massive scale. We need to start talking about it in those terms and hold the media accountable for the lack of ethical standards.  The mainstream media – including, sadly, major segments of the presumably conservative media, like the Wall Street Journal — are working overtime to keep the American public and the American voters in the dark on the scope of illegal alien crime. The murder of Kate Steinle in San Francisco exposed only the tip of a massive iceberg, and the media establishment is desperate to avoid dealing with the iceberg underneath.  Let’s look at a few numbers. You haven’t seen them in the New York Times, Atlanta Constitution, or the Miami Herald, nor have they been featured on NBC Nightly news or CNN. So, the average American is blissfully unaware of them.  Between 2008 and 2014, 40% of all murder convictions in Florida were criminal aliens. In New York it was 34% and Arizona 17.8%.  During those years, criminal aliens accounted for 38% of all murder convictions in the five states of California, Texas, Arizona, Florida and New York, while illegal aliens constitute only 5.6% of the total population in those states.  That 38% represents 7,085 murders out of the total of 18,643.  That 5.6% figure for the average illegal alien population in those five states comes from US Census estimates. We know the real number is double that official estimate. Yet, even if it is 11%, it is still shameful that the percentage of murders by criminal aliens is more than triple the illegal population in those states.  Those astounding numbers were compiled by the Government Accountability Office GAO using official Department of Justice data on criminal aliens in the nation’s correctional system. The numbers were the basis for a presentation at a recent New Hampshire conference sponsored by the highly respected Center for Security Policy. You can view the full presentation here:  The federal Bureau of Prisons category “criminal aliens” includes legal immigrants who have been convicted of serious crimes, but over 90% of incarcerated criminal aliens are illegal aliens, so it is reasonable to use these numbers as a close approximation of the extent of illegal alien crime.  Similar data is available at the state level if state officials have the desire to look for it. The Texas Department of Public Safety reports that between 2008 and 2014, 35% of the all murder convictions were illegal aliens—averaging 472 murders each year from 2004 to 2008.  Do you know the numbers for your state? Does your congressman, Senator, or Governor know those numbers? Of course not. If you are afraid of the answer, don’t ask the question.  There is widespread public ignorance of illegal alien crime in every state because the mainstream media does investigate such matters. Why? Because they do not want the public to think about such things. The media, from the Associated Press down to the Main Street News, does not even allow the phrase “illegal immigrant” to appear in print.  So, the numbers are out there in the criminal justice system and correctional institutions, waiting to be compiled and published. State attorneys general and state legislators could access the data if they were interested, and so could the media, but they don’t. In fact, in Colorado in 2006, the state legislature passed a law ordering the state Attorney General to compile accurate data on the costs of incarcerating illegal aliens and send a bill for reimbursement to the federal government. The state AG sent the feds a bill for only half the real costs — the cost of inmates in the state prison system and not the costs imposed on taxpayers by an equal number of inmates in county jails across the state.  The US Department of Justice’s Bureau of Justice Programs publishes an annual report on the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, a report that includes data on the number of criminal aliens incarcerated each state prison system and each county jail. It takes some prodigious digging to find the data, but it is there.  But our mainstream media, our self-described guardians of the First Amendment, consciously avoids the effort and declines to put a public spotlight on the problem or demand public scrutiny and public accountability. Why?  The answer is that public debate on the problem of illegal alien crime does not serve the progressive political agenda. The issue is swept under the rug and anyone who raises it is called a racist.  This is media malpractice of historic proportions, and publishers and editors are the unindicted coconspirators in those 7,085 murders.",FALSE
"As the government shutdown dragged on, gloom mounted. James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, warned that foreign intelligence services might swoop in and recruit furloughed C.I.A. workers. That seemed a little paranoid, but then we’re talking about spies. The C.I.A.-doom scenario sounded a bit like the problems facing the cast of “Homeland” this season, except for the part where a member of Congress is a terrorist mole who falls in love with an intelligence agent who frequently fails to take her bipolar disorder medication. Reality in Washington has gotten so muddled that the land in “Homeland” is looking sort of attractive. On Wednesday, House Republicans pushed to refund bits and pieces of the government that the members particularly like, such as veterans and the National Guard. Also anything that lends itself to a dramatic press conference, such as national parks and cancer treatment for children. Since the House proposals are never going anywhere in the Senate, there’s a limit to what you want to know about what went on during the debate. Let’s summarize: Democrats: “Meaningless political theater!” Republicans: “Come to the table!” Coming to the table has now replaced strangling Obamacare as the most popular G.O.P. war cry. There is a longstanding political rule that when all else fails, you demand more talking. If you’re running for office against a guy who’s got 70 percent in the polls, it’s time to call for a debate. If you’re already having four debates, it’s time to call for six. “Why don’t we sit down and have a conference committee about how we’re going to fund the federal government?” demanded Representative Ander Crenshaw of Florida. Republicans have posed this question a lot, and it would be an excellent one if they were not the same folks who have spent the last half-year refusing to sit down and have a conference committee about the federal budget.",partially false
"A long list of reputable media outlets such as CNN and BBC have misquoted Italian police about a neo-Nazi group that fought for the government in Ukraine, falsely reporting that they were linked to Donbass separatists instead. The Italian state police said on Monday that it had seized a cache of Nazi memorabilia and weapons – including a missile – from a neo-Nazi gang in northern Italy. The operation, the police said, was a result of a year-long investigation into far-right political movements who had fought “against the separatists” in Ukraine's eastern breakaway region of Donbass. Despite the rather unambiguous wording of the police statement, a host of mainstream media outlets got it dramatically wrong, essentially reporting the exact opposite. Also on rt.com Italian police seize MISSILE, guns and neo-Nazi material in raid on far-right militants Citing either the police or unspecified “Italian media,” outlets including Reuters, CNN, the Guardian, BBC and CBS reported that the group “had fought alongside Russian-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine” CNN, Reuters, “took part in the Russian-backed insurgency” The Guardian, or that the raid was carried out “as part of an investigation into Italian far-right help for Russian-backed separatists” BBC. While the original statement leaves little room for error, several Italian outlets did rephrase it to sound less precise, describing the neo-Nazis as having taken part in the Ukrainian conflict. The police statement is worded in a similar way. It is possible that multiple people jumped to the same wrong conclusion, or that an initial mis-translation got picked up by a crowd of media outlets known for their anti-Russian bias, who proceeded to skip fact-checking in favor of a narrative that reinforces it. Either way the strategy seems to be bearing fruit, as only a few commentators on social media have taken issue with the false report. Italian media make sense: these nazis were on Ukrainean nazis side against Russian supported rebels. But BBC embarrassed to be on the same side as these nazis in the civil war in Ukraine lies and says the opposite. This is an orwellian-style propaganda piece. #thisispropaganda — Helmholz Watson @HelmholzWatson July 15, 2019 Official Italian police statement says the Nazis with the missiles fought against [pro-Russian] separatists.

"Hollywood elites “eat whole babies for Christmas” according to Jim Carrey, who warns “dark forces” are “engaged in a battle for America’s soul“, and the outcome of this battle will have “long-lasting consequences for the entire world.“  “These kids are fattened up for the Christmas table like geese and turkeys, except the animals don’t go through the ritual abuse, the psychological torment that these kids are forced to suffer.“  “These people believe the more the child has suffered, the better it tastes. They believe the negative emotions coursing through the kid’s body, the adrenaline and hatred, will give them special powers. It’s a Hollywood thing influenced by old school Satanism.“  Speaking at a post-screening Q&A for documentary Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond in New York, Carrey said that Christmas and New Year are a time of year he dreads, because of the “dark energy pulsating around Tinsel Town” and his knowledge of “what goes on behind the closed doors of the elite at this time of year.“  “Luciferians in Hollywood turn Christmas into the darkest festival of the year,” Carrey said, before explaining “there is a reason why people around the world feel a heaviness at this time of year.“  “Institutional oppression and Satanism hang in the air while we are all forced to wear smiles and ignore the gut feeling that all is not well.”  “Ever notice how all the homeless children you see throughout the year begin to dissapear at Xmas? You think it’s because they’ve found a home, found shelter, found love and warmth?“  “Christmas time is Satanic slaughter time. They are determined to pervert the most beautiful time of the year into a festival of suffering and blood.”’  Jim & Andy: The Great Beyond charts Jim Carrey’s evolution into cult comedian Andy Kaufman for 1999 film Man on the Moon, a performance which saw Carrey maintain the Kaufman’s oddball identity for the duration of the shoot. However in New York on Friday, Carrey warned of the seriousness of his allegations against Hollywood elite.  “The entertainment industry is the PR and brainwashing branch of the New World Order, the globalist empire of Lucifarianism,” Carrey said, warning. “There will be a strong push to normalize Satanism in 2018.

"A U.S. ambassador on Wednesday explicitly linked President Trump, Vice President Pence and other senior officials to what he came to believe was a campaign to pressure a foreign government to investigate Trump’s political rival in exchange for a coveted White House meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid. The potentially historic, if hotly disputed, testimony from U.S. Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland is the most damaging yet for Trump in Congress’s intensifying inquiry into whether the president should be impeached. More forcefully than he has before, Sondland declared that the Trump administration would not give Ukraine’s newly elected president, Volodymyr Zelensky, a chance to visit the White House — unless Zelensky agreed to announce investigations that could help the president politically. “I know that members of this committee frequently frame these complicated issues in the form of a simple question: Was there a ‘quid pro quo’?” Sondland said. “. . . With regard to the requested White House call and the White House meeting, the answer is yes.” Sondland came to Capitol Hill as perhaps the most anticipated witness of the Democrats’ inquiry — a longtime Republican donor and Trump loyalist whose shifting accounts made it unclear which side of the political aisle his testimony might benefit more. He said after the hearing that he intended to stay in his post. But nearly from the moment his testimony began, it was clear he was ready to cast aspersions not just on the president, but also on the highest-ranking officials in his government. Sondland acknowledged that he and others were the ones pushing Ukrainians to announce investigations, but asserted they had merely “followed the president’s orders,” communicated through Trump’s personal lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani. Sondland testified that top-level officials — including Pence, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — were made aware at various points of what was happening, and he provided emails to back up his assertions.",TRUE
"FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE December 30, 2013 Contact: Rebecca Acuña Wendy R. Davis for Governor Campaign Davis: Perry Should Fire William White Fort Worth, TX: Senator Wendy Davis today called on Governor Rick Perry to remove William White as Chairman of the Finance Commission of Texas in the wake of controversial statements made by White to the El Paso Times. White’s position oversees the Office of the Consumer Credit Commissioner, the agency charged with protecting Texas consumers. In a blatant conflict of interest, William White, a Vice President for Cash America International, defended his employer instead of Texas consumers in an interview with the newspaper. Cash America is a payday lender that was fined $19 million dollars by the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last month for abusive practices. “Texans are tired of backroom deals and dishonesty in Austin,” said Senator Wendy Davis. “William White can’t protect Texas consumers while he represents a predatory lending company on the side. Mr. White should resign from his post – and if he won’t, Governor Perry should remove him.” A 2006 Department of Defense study concluded that payday lending and other high-cost lending products are a threat to military readiness and destructive to the morale of troops on active deployment. The President of the Navy Marine Corps Relief Society called payday lending in particular “the most serious single financial problem that we have encountered in [a] hundred years.” This isn’t the first time Sen. Davis pointed to William White’s conflict of interest. In 2011, Senator Davis called White’s appointment to the commission, “the classic fox in the henhouse.” She said, “It’s really disgusting that an industry that profits from the poor by charging 1,000-plus interest is put at the head of the state’s financial regulatory agency. It’s saying, ‘It’s not only OK, but we’re going to put them in charge.’ ” Sen. Davis has been a champion for payday lending reform since joining the Texas Senate in 2009. She has filed multiple bills targeted at reform. Senator Davis has filed legislation that would close the credit service organization loophole, limit the interest rate charged to U.S. military members and their dependents, and cap the interest payday lenders can charge. Both the Texas Baptist Christian Life Commission and the Texas Catholic Conference have applauded Senator Davis in her work to reduce payday lending. In 2012, the Texas Baptist Christian Life Commission presented Senator Wendy Davis with the Horizon Award to recognize her work to curb predatory lending practices in Texas. ###",partially false

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE  Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, Mar 3, 2020  Shanghai Government Officially Recommends Vitamin C for COVID-19  by Andrew W. Saul  OMNS Mar 3, 2020 The government of Shanghai, China has announced its official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high amounts of intravenous vitamin C. 1 Dosage recommendations vary with severity of illness, from 50 to 200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 200 mg/kg/day.  These dosages are approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mg for an adult, administered by IV. This specific method of administration is important, says intravenous therapy expert Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD, because vitamin C's effect is at least ten times more powerful by IV than if taken orally. Dr. Yanagisawa is president of the Tokyo-based Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy. He says, Intravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.  Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, a Chinese-American specialist physician, has been working closely with medical and governmental authorities throughout China. He has been instrumental in facilitating at least three Chinese clinical IV vitamin C studies now underway. Dr. Cheng is presently in Shanghai continuing his efforts to encourage still more Chinese hospitals to implement vitamin C therapy incorporating high oral doses as well as C by IV.  Dr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa both recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19 infection.  An official statement from Xi'an Jiaotong University Second Hospital 2 reads:  On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . .

"I&I Editorial Democrats nearly had a brawl last week in California after the party’s Resolutions Committee rejected a proposed climate debate among Democratic presidential candidates. Global warming so fully occupies the thinking of some that there’s no room for information that will contradict their faith. If they’d only open their minds they’d see: The U.S. hasn’t warmed since 2005. America isn’t the entire world. But the alarmists gleefully point out regional heatwaves and the “hottest day on record” when cities endure summer scorchers. So let’s look at the data. The U.S. Climate Reference Network, “a . America isn’t the entire world. But the alarmists gleefully point out regional heatwaves and the “hottest day on record” when cities endure summer scorchers. So let’s look at the data. The U.S. Climate Reference Network, “a sophisticated climate-observing network specifically designed and deployed for quantifying climate change on a national scale,” has found there’s been no warming in the U.S. going back to 2005. In fact, says meteorologist Anthony Watts, the “little known data from the state-of-the-art” operation, “(which never seems to make it into NOAA’s monthly ‘state of the climate’ reports) show that for the past nine months, six of them were below normal .” The data also tell us 2019’s average has been cooler than 2005’s, the first year of the data set. Man’s carbon dioxide emissions are not burning down the Amazon. Empty-headed celebrities and activists have had quite a virtue-signaling feast tweeting photos from fires three decades ago, fires in Europe, and fires in the U.S. Yes, we’ve seen the claims that there are 80% more fires this year than last in South America, but we’ve also seen this from the New York Times: “The majority of these fires were set by farmers preparing Amazon-adjacent farmland for next year’s crops and pasture.” lockerdome.com is blocked Requests to the server have been blocked by an extension.

It was a turning point — the ‘greenhouse effect’ captured attention. But, in 1999 it became clear that carbon dioxide rose and fell after temperatures did . By 2003, we had better data showing the lag was 800 ± 200 years. CO2 was in the back seat.” Of course the climate crusaders have written at great length to tell us it’s all just a myth. This time, they say, the warming ( which is in doubt ) is caused by man. It just has to be. All those other warming periods, the alarmists tell us, can be explained by natural events, such as Earth’s orbit around the sun, which, incidentally, we have mentioned as one of many factors that influence climate changes Less than 5% of carbon dioxide emissions are produced by man. Web searches turn up what seems like an endless list of stories and blog posts reporting that CO2 levels in the atmosphere have reached or exceeded 415 parts per million. This has been almost universally treated as the tip of an imminent disaster, as man has pushed greenhouse gas emissions beyond a dangerous threshold. But has he? The United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “agrees today’s annual human carbon dioxide emissions are 4.5 ppm (parts per million) per year and nature’s carbon dioxide emissions are 98 ppm per year,” says climate scientist Ed Berry. “Yet, the IPCC claims human emissions have caused all the increase in carbon dioxide since 1750, which is 30% of today’s total. “How can human carbon dioxide, which is less than 5% of natural carbon dioxide, cause 30% of today’s atmospheric carbon dioxide? It can’t .” Don’t like Berry’s numbers? Consider another set of figures from the IPCC’s Fourth Assessment Report, which says that of the 750 gigatons of CO2 which travel through the carbon cycle every year, only 29 gigatons, or less than 4%, are produced by man. Is it possible for such a small portion to have such a great influence? Despite what the hysterics tell us, it’s an unanswered question. There are many other unanswered questions about climate, as well. An honest person would admit that they might remain unanswered forever. An alarmist, however, has his mind made up — and closed down.",partially false

"Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton responds to questioning on the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks in Benghazi, Libya, during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 23, 2013. Credit: Jason Reed / Reuters  By  Fifteen months ago, I asked then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton why she hadn't simply picked up the phone and talked to the Benghazi survivors to find out what had actually happened. Instead of being straightforward, she deflected this uncomfortable question with a now-infamous question of her own: What difference, at this point, does it make?  The answer to that question and the motive behind this administration's lies and coverup are finally becoming quite clear. The belated release of a Sept. 14, 2012, talking points email from deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes proves that senior White House officials were fully engaged in directing the coverup and perpetuating the lies.  According to the Rhodes email, the goal of the administration's Benghazi spin was to underscore that these protests are rooted in an Internet video, and not a broader failure of policy. This was in spite of the fact that within hours of the Sept. 11, 2012, attack, the administration knew — or certainly should have known — there was no protest.  So why did the administration lie to America?  Because the truth would have damaged President Barack Obama's re-election chances and further revealed Clinton's dereliction of duty that contributed to the unnecessary deaths of four brave Americans. She fully understood her culpability in the Benghazi tragedy, which is why she reacted so testily to my reasonable line of questioning.  The outrages surrounding the Benghazi attack involve administration action, or lack of action, before, during and after the attack.  The greatest outrages occurred before the attack. The State Department not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security but instead actually reduced security in Libya. Although no one can say with certainty, I firmly believe a relatively small contingent of armed military guards would have prevented the attack, and those four lives would not have been lost.  The outrageous act of omission during the attack was that no additional defensive or offensive military assets were immediately dispatched to help the endangered personnel in Benghazi. Although it is true that no intervention to save the lives of Ambassador Christopher Stevens or diplomat Sean Smith was possible, I do not believe the same can be said with certainty concerning U.S. personnel Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty, who also were killed that night.  No one could know with certainty that the survivors would be able to get to the airport and be safely evacuated within 12 hours. What if they had encountered resistance en route to the airport? There were military assets in Croatia that could have arrived within the 12-hour window it took the survivors to reach safety. Didn't the administration feel obligated to deploy every asset available until the moment the survivors were safe?  Finally, there are the outrageous lies and coverups after the attack. There were many, but I want to concentrate on one: Clinton's comments to Woods' father at the moment she should have been demonstrating only genuine compassion.  Imagine yourself in her role, honoring the remains of four brave Americans who had given their lives for their country. Would you have taken that moment to offer sincere condolences and to grieve with the families? Or would you have seized the opportunity to plant and perpetuate the coverup of your dereliction of duty?  In the words of Woods' father, Clinton did the latter: Hillary Clinton came up to me and I gave her a handshake and a hug, and when I shook her hand, she said to me, 'We are going to have the filmmaker arrested.' Even at that time, she was trying to place a spin on what happened.  What difference does it make? I'll let my fellow Americans judge for themselves.

""We have received a number of calls regarding how to enter security information for a baby that has not yet been born,"" Shafer wrote. ""Crazy as it may sound, you MUST include the baby in the overall count of guests in the tour. It’s an easy process."" The newsletter then proceeds to spell out how ""the baby’s security information should be entered"" into the White House system, including such details as: ""GENDER: if the parents know put that gender down if not, you can enter either M or F as we’ll ask you to update it at the time of birth."" All of the information should be updated ""once, the baby is born,"" the newsletter instructs. ""It is ironic that President Obama's staff recognizes the existence of unborn babies for purposes of providing security within the White House -- yet, there is no indication that President Obama has any problem with the fact that throughout the District of Columbia, abortion is now legal for any reason up to the moment of birth,” said Douglas Johnson, National Right to Life legislative director. “Notably, the newsletter provides no guidance on what the staff should do if an unborn baby is first registered for security purposes, but then aborted. On May 17, the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee plans to hold a hearing on the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 3803), which would generally prohibit abortion in the sixth month and later in the District. If the President wants to provide for the security of the unborn child immediately outside of the White House gates, as well as inside, he should endorse this bill.""

"Parents living in some parts of the country are 50 times more likely to have their term-time holidays approved than those in others, statistics show. Government figures reveal a postcode lottery in terms of a family's chances of taking their child out of classes without being fined. Torbay in Devon is the best place to live if you want to take secondary school children away during the term, with 51 per cent of all term time holidays given official approval. For primary age children, North Yorkshire gets the best deal – with 51 per cent of holidays given the green light there. The worst place for granting trips to secondary age children is Redbridge in London, where less than 1 per cent are granted, while for primary age it is Southampton, where 3 per cent are granted. For primary age children, North Yorkshire gets the best deal – with 51 per cent of holidays given the green light there file photo of primary school children above The data suggests a wide disparity in how schools and councils have been interpreting government rules which ban parents from taking their children out of school for holidays. A separate investigation for the BBC yesterday showed that 35 councils have changed their stance on term time fines since the case of Isle of Wight father Jon Platt. He overturned his fine in the High Court after arguing that his children had otherwise excellent attendance. Of 108 councils where data was available, 35 have altered their stance on the fines – with 28 no longer issuing them altogether. A further five councils are currently reviewing the policy. Term-time holiday campaigner David Hedley said: 'There is very little clarity on what is allowed. 'So many people struggle to get time off during the school holidays – especially those who work shift work in public services. 'It's not fair to continue to impose these very strict rules, the circumstances of the family should be taken into account. 'Families across the country are being penalised and it is ridiculous.' The figures for 2014-15 reveal the local authorities where the largest percentage of holidays were approved also include Shropshire and Herefordshire for both secondary and primary age children. Meanwhile, only a small percentage of holidays were approved for older children in Bracknell Forest, Leicester and Barnsley or for younger children in Luton, Rochdale and Bexley, London. Going on holiday outside of peak season can knock thousands off the price for a family, as travel companies force people to pay a premium during the school break. However, taking children on holiday during the term time has been banned since 2013 following new guidelines introduced by former education secretary Michael Gove. It has meant flouting parents have been slapped with fines of £60 per child, and many have been taken to court when they have refused to pay. The 2014-15 statistics appear to show many head teachers have been ignoring the rules and allowing parents to take their children away anyway. And this trend sped up in May 2016, when Isle of Wight father Jon Platt overturned his fine in the High Court, arguing that taking children away was legal as long as their overall attendance was excellent across the year. Councils and head teachers are now reluctant to enforce the ban because they know magistrates' courts will be unable to uphold the fines following the landmark case. The 2014-15 statistics from school registers also showed a record number of parents taking their children out of classes for holidays without approval of the head teacher. A total of 3.2million school days were lost – compared with just 2.6million two years previously. Over the same time period the number of days of authorised holiday had fallen from 4.1million to just under 900,000. The Department for Education is supporting an appeal by Mr Platt's council against the High Court's decision, and the case will go before the Supreme Court later this year. A Department for Education spokesperson said: 'Children should not be taken out of school without good reason. 'The evidence shows every extra day of school missed can affect a pupil's chances of achieving good GCSEs, which has a lasting effect on their future, vindicating our strong stance on attendance. 'Local authorities and schools are taking tough action on addressing absence, as has been seen in the downward trend in overall absence figures in recent years.' A spokesman for Redbridge Council said: 'We are very proud of our high performing schools and students. Our most recent GCSE results were excellent. 'One of the reasons our students are able to achieve such results is because they attend school regularly and we discourage holidays during term time so that that are taken only when absolutely necessary.' Darren Paffey, cabinet member for education at Southampton Council, said: 'We want all children in Southampton to get a good education and the first step to achieving this is ensuring excellent school attendance. 'We support headteachers' efforts to enforce attendance rules, and do so in a way that is firm but fair.'",TRUE
"Theresa May has admitted the Government’s social security experts were not consulted before a controversial decision to deny disability benefits to 160,000 vulnerable people. The Social Security Advisory Committee SSAC was only informed of the changes to Personal Independence Payments PIP “on the day they were being introduced”, MPs were told. The admission was described as “outrageous”, as the row dominated Prime Minister’s Questions and led Jeremy Corbyn to brand the Conservatives “the nasty party” again. Meanwhile, The Independent can reveal that the SSAC will now consider the new PIP regulations at a meeting next Wednesday. It raises the prospect of the committee criticising the decision before MPs vote on it, with a threatened Tory revolt – which must happen before 16 March. The Government is introducing emergency legislation to tighten the criteria for PIP, after a tribunal ruled they should also cover conditions including epilepsy, diabetes and dementia. The ruling would cost at least £3.7bn over the next five years, money which should go to “really disabled people who need it”, one minister said – before later apologising.

In the Commons, the Labour leader said: “This is a shameful decision that will affect people with dementia, those suffering cognitive disorders due to stroke, military veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and those with schizophrenia.” He urged Ms May to “think again” – raising the SSAC, which normally consulted on proposed changes “before the regulations are laid in Parliament”. In reply, the Prime Minister insisted no one currently receiving PIP would “see a reduction in their benefits”. She told MPs: “What the court said is the regulations were unclear – that is why we’re clarifying the regulations and we’re ensuring they reflect the original intention that was agreed by this Parliament.” And she added: “The Work and Pensions Secretary called the chairman of the Social Security Advisory Committee and spoke to him about the regulations on the day they were being introduced.” Tim Farron, the Liberal Democrat leader, said later: “Given that these changes will impact over 150,000 disabled people, it is outrageous that the Government did not allow these changes to be considered by the Social Security Committee.” A DWP spokeswoman said it was allowed to bypass the SSAC when announcing new regulations if the decision was a “matter of urgency”. And she argued that was the case with the PIP ruling, which “threatened to undermine the consistency of assessments and create confusion” – although it was made in December. The Independent understands the last time the SSAC was not consulted on a welfare measure was in the previous parliament, over cuts to migrant benefits. Mr Corbyn also attacked the comments by George Freeman, the head of the Downing Street policy unit, noting that Ms May, in 2002, described the Tories as the “nasty party”. “Her policy chair suggested people with debilitating conditions were those who, and I quote, ‘take pills at home, who suffer from anxiety and were not really disabled’. Isn’t that proof the nasty party is still around?” he asked. But Ms May said she hoped MPs would accept Mr Freeman’s apology, issued earlier this week. The tribunal also said that claimants who needed support to take medication should be assessed in the same way as those managing therapies such as dialysis at home.",other

"The biggest ever rise in public dissatisfaction with the NHS was recorded last year, according to a long-running survey.  The British Social Attitudes Survey has been tracking satisfaction since 1983.  The 2015 poll of nearly 2,200 people showed satisfaction with the NHS at 60% - down from a peak of 70% in 2010.  Some 23% said they were actively dissatisfied - a rise of eight percentage points on the year before and the biggest single jump in a year. Graph on NHS satisfaction  Waiting times were cited as the biggest reason for dissatisfaction - mentioned by over half of people - followed by there being not enough staff.  The findings come amid growing pressure on waiting times for cancer care, A&E and routine operations, such as knee and hip operations.  Patients reported highest satisfaction rates for GP services and lowest for social care, which is run by local authorities and covers home help for tasks such as washing and dressing, and care homes.  The survey - carried out by NatCen Social Research - covered Scotland, Wales and England. The differences between the three nations were not considered to be statistically significant. Graph on NHS satisfaction Graph on NHS satisfaction  Chris Ham, chief executive of the King's Fund think-tank, said that while overall satisfaction levels were still high by historical standards, the findings should act as a real wake up call.  What's gone wrong is the public's perception of the NHS under growing pressure. Money is tight, waiting times are getting longer, people are concerned that when they need the NHS it might not be there for them.  Rob Webster, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, agreed the public needed reassurance about the future of the NHS.  But he said the most important set of results were on social care. He said the satisfaction levels were deeply concerning and said the system needed greater funding.  A spokesman for the Department of Health in England said: There is pressure on the NHS as our population ages, and that's why the government is investing record amounts to transform care.

"OAN Newsroom  UPDATED 8:04 AM PT – Thursday, November 19, 2020  President Trump is pointing to the latest evidence of an illegal ballot-dump in Wisconsin. In a tweet Wednesday, the President said Democrat Joe Biden received a major dump of more than 143,000 ballots on the night after the election.  He noted, the illegal dump took place in the early morning hours on November 4 when Democrats realized they were losing in the state. The 2020 Trump campaign is now mounting a legal challenge to prevent the certification of fraudulent election results in Wisconsin.  Look at this in Wisconsin!

Trump @realDonaldTrump November 19, 2020  Meanwhile, witnesses of voting fraud in Detroit, Michigan have come forward to detail alleged ballot dumps in favor of Biden. In a video testimony Wednesday, poll worker Kristina Karamo said she personally witnessed spoiled and invalid ballots being awarded to Biden.  “It was like so much going on, but I did personally witness the ballots being delivered between 3 o’clock and 3:30 a.m.,” she stated. “So I did personally witness ballots arriving at the time.”  Karamo, who worked at Detroit’s TCF Center, also said election officials did not review signatures on ballots. She added, suspicious batches of ballots were delivered to the TCF Center at night and all of them went to Biden.  Meanwhile, Sen. Rand Paul R-Ky. is calling for an investigation of suspected voter fraud in key battleground states.  “We need to figure out how many votes came in after the deadline and the court has ruled those are illegal,” he noted. “Then if it’s a significant number, we need to figure out and readjust the totals so the votes will now be illegal.”  On Wednesday, the senator said the 2020 Trump campaign should check samples of 2,000 random votes for fraud and other irregularities. He added, this would allow officials to build a statistical model to prove rampant voter fraud in court.",FALSE

EDUCATION Under the SNP, teacher numbers have declined by 4000, there are 1000 fewer support staff and ­Scotland’s performance in ­international assessments of maths, science and reading is declining. Meanwhile, the gap in educational attainment separating children from richer and poorer ­backgrounds remains as stubborn as ever.

"Following in the footsteps of his mentor, Barak Hussein Obama, Joe Biden is preparing to cower to the Iranian Caliphate in the form of a $3 trillion apology for the Trump administration’s assassination of their top General, Qassem Soleimani.  While the assassination was celebrated by democracies worldwide, Democrats in the US accused Trump of showboating, resulting in raised tensions with the Muslim country.  The continuous funneling of cash from US taxpayers to Iran between the Obama, and now Biden administrations, is shameful. While our veterans lay homeless on our streets and our corporations are being threatened with higher taxes, Democrats have decided to fund a known enemy to the US.  This is the very definition of treason. Not even bleeding heart Jimmy Carter sank so low in his dealings with Iran.  The jet, handpicked by Biden’s Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, is a Dassault Falcon 8X. While the Dassault made its name in the military and commercial aircraft space, the larger Falcon jets carved out a niche in the business space due to their impressive range 5,950 nautical miles, a digital flight control system, and an ability to customize the plane’s interiors into 30+ formats depending on usage priorities.  With the versatility to make both long-range and short-range trips courtesy of a tri-jet engine, the Falcon models offer speed, efficiency, and improved comfort. Sources tell us there will be a handwritten note from Biden on top of the cash that will simply say, “Enjoy the cash. Keep the Jet.”  Due to its payload, this flight will take on a particular significance in aeronautic history. It will be the most valuable payload ever transported by aircraft. To bear this grave responsibility, Bilken enlisted retired US Airways pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger, famed pilot depicted by the legendary Tom Hanks in the 2016 blockbuster hit “Sully”.  Sullenberger insisted his longtime personal flight steward Andres Esquer be along for the all-important flight. Esquer famously served an entire Boeing 777 full of rowdy Oasis fans two cocktails each from one single liter of vodka on an international flight from Heathrow to JFK in 1998, a feat that is still mentioned during pillow talk amongst flight attendants and pilots to this day.  He is certified in CPR and BJJ. He is also an amateur pilot, more than capable of manhandling the aircraft should anything unfortunate befall Sully.

"Get ready for another big rise in train fares. This Wednesday we’ll see the publication of the latest retail prices index RPI. The Office for National Statistics thinks it is such a poor indicator of prices that it now designates it as “Not a National Statistic.” Yet this non-statistic, which is nearly always significantly higher than the CPI consumer prices index is nonetheless used as the official basis for raising train fares. And all the signs are that the squeeze on commuters is only going to get worse.  The cost of season tickets for commuters goes up in January, but the rise is dictated by the level of RPI the previous July, a figure usually published in mid-August. When the July figure for RPI is released this Wednesday, it will be at least 3.4% its current level but more likely 3.5% or even 3.6%, as petrol prices and home energy bill increases feed into the index. So with grim inevitability train fares will, yet again, rise faster than wages.  If rail fares were to go up in line with CPI, we could expect a rise of 2.4% next January. If they went up in line with wages, we’d expect a 2.5% increase. But the RPI formula means they regularly go up faster than wages. This time last year the RPI was 3.6%, enabling the rail companies to shove through big price increases on commuter routes at a time when wage growth was stalling.  What does a 3.5% rise mean in practice? For commuters from Cambridge into London terminals’ such as King’s Cross, the annual season ticket at the beginning of 2019 will smash through the £5,000 level, jumping from £4,952 to £5,125.  It’s worth noting that in Germany, Deutsche Bahn offers the BahnCard 100 that lets you board any train anywhere in the country for a year for €4,270 £3,840. In Britain we expect commuters to pay £1,263 more than that just for a 48-mile commuter journey from Cambridgeshire into the capital.  Meanwhile, a 3.5% rise will see the annual season ticket from Tunbridge Wells into London terminals jump from £4,644 to £4,806, while Reading to London will go from £4,464 to £4,620. Rochdale to Manchester will cost £1,196 instead of £1,156. And spare a thought for the miserable passengers on Britain’s officially most overcrowded route, the early morning train from Uckfield in Sussex to London Bridge, which on average is 250% full. They can expect to fork out another £105 on top of the £3,000 they are currently paying for an annual season ticket.  As the chancellor, Philip Hammond, prepares his autumn budget, he might want to listen to the Campaign for Better Transport: “We want the government to commit to a fares freeze and hold regulated rail fares at their current level. The government has frozen fuel duty for the last seven years and we think rail passengers should be given the same treatment. Given the mess surrounding the new timetable, the lack of improvements and the failure to deliver compensation, the government cannot go on telling passengers that fare increases are justified.”  Our train companies this week said they are trying to clean up ticketing. The Rail Delivery Group is getting rid of language such as “route direct”, “any permitted” and “London terminals” to simplify the system. It even proclaims there has already been an 11% improvement in the number of people buying the wrong ticket at a vending machine. But it remains absolutely astonishing that one in 10 ticket buyers still purchase the wrong ticket – usually leaving the traveller out of pocket, not the rail company – because we have such an absurdly complicated fares structure.

"SHARE By of the Madison — Gov. Scott Walker called a special legislative session Thursday to use a projected $100 million surplus to push down property taxes on the typical home by 0.4% more than expected this year. The two-year proposal would lower the December tax bill on the median-valued home by an additional $13 over current estimates, to $2,925. Next year, taxes under Walker's plan would rise modestly so that over two years they would be an estimated $11 more than they are now on the typical home. The total property taxes levied around the state on all property — from homes and businesses to farmland — would still increase because of other factors, such as new construction. Under Walker's proposal, total property taxes would rise by 1.2% this year and 1.8% next year. They would simply not increase as much as they are projected to go up under the two-year state budget the governor signed in June. At a Capitol news conference, Walker said he wanted to deliver the tax cut for December's property tax bills and to do that lawmakers needed to act quickly because local officials are in the process of finalizing their budgets and determining their tax levies. ""The more we looked at that, the more we looked at the size of the surplus, we said if we're going to do it, let's go big and go bold,"" Walker told reporters. ""Let's have dramatic impact on the people of the state when they're paying their property tax bill."" The move by the Republican governor would further stretch the state's small cash reserves over the next two years at a time when a partisan budget fight in Washington has eroded consumer confidence. The announcement came three days after Democrat and former Trek Bicycle Corp. executive Mary Burke announced she was challenging Walker in the 2014 race. The early remarks by both candidates have focused on improving the state's economy. ""I'm all in favor of lower taxes and supporting our schools, but I'd have to make sure that it really is doing just that, and it's doing it in a way that's fiscally responsible and balancing the budget,"" Burke said during a Green Bay news conference Thursday, according to video posted on the website of the Green Bay Press-Gazette. ""We're at record-high debt levels and our budget is at an all-time high as well, so we have to make sure we're being responsible and accountable for the funds that we're using."" Walker's proposal would increase state aid to local schools by $100 million over the next two years but not allow them to increase their total spending as limited by state-imposed caps. That would have the effect of forcing school officials to lower property taxes. According to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the typical state home is expected to see a $5 decrease in property taxes on December's bills to $2,938. Walker's proposal would come on top of that, dropping property taxes an additional $13. For bills that go out in December 2014, the typical homeowner would see a property tax bill of $2,974 under current law. Walker's plan would lower that number by $20. Projections by the nonpartisan fiscal bureau estimate that the state's main account will finish the current budget in June 2015 with $191 million in it. That number will change Tuesday when the state closes its books on the fiscal year ended in June — a process that in turn affects the state's starting balance for the current budget and all future projections. The $100 million in new school aid proposed by Walker would have to come out of the surplus being revised next week. In addition, the state's rainy day fund has about $280 million in it, which amounts to a small fraction of the overall state budget. Shortfall in next budget Walker's proposal would add to the shortfall of $545 million that is already being projected by the fiscal bureau for the next state budget starting in 2015-'17. Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said the plan reminded him of a tactic used by former Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle to lower property taxes ahead of his successful 2006 re-election bid. Berry said he was concerned that the hard-won surplus that the state is carrying into the current budget will be spent over the next two years despite the uncertainty hanging over the national economy. ""We're spending more in this year and next year than we're taking in, and that's a fact,"" Berry said. The plan will be formally introduced Friday and the Legislature's Joint Finance Committee will hold a hearing on it and approve it on Tuesday, said Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester). The Assembly will likely take it up two days later, on Oct. 17, Vos said. The Senate could also take it up that day but might not do it until the following week,said Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills), co-chairwoman of the finance committee. Two other bills will be included in Walker's special session — one to give a tax credit for historic preservation and one to grant towns tax incremental financing powers. The latter is aimed at helping development around a proposed Amazon distribution center in Kenosha, but Democrats raised concerns about how broadly the measure could be applied elsewhere. Too fast, Dems say Rep. Sandy Pasch (D-Shorewood) said Walker's timetable for passing the proposal in as little as a week was too fast and that Democrats would need time to determine what the proposal means for schools, taxpayers and the state budget. Pasch said she wanted to consider whether the state's economy would benefit more from the tax cut or more from allowing the money to be spent by schools to make up for past cuts. Pasch said she also wanted to see how the additional spending by the state to cut local property taxes would affect the state's projected shortfall for the 2015-'17 budget. ""People love that, of course. Nobody wants to pay more in taxes,"" Pasch said of the proposed cut. ""The devil's in the details."" Pasch said that Walker didn't mention the proposal in a meeting with Democratic legislative leaders on Wednesday. She questioned the timing of the proposal following Burke's announcement Monday of her candidacy. ""It seems more politics than something that will have an impact for the average taxpayer,"" Pasch said. ""It gives me great pause."" Vos said the move would help improve the economy and allow taxpayers to benefit from the state's surplus. ""The reforms we made early in (Walker's) term with the Republican-led Legislature are really paying dividends for every single family across the state,"" Vos said. ""What we're doing today is sharing those dividends from the good decisions that have been made by the elected officials in Madison with the hard-working families all across Wisconsin.""

"The Democrats in Congress just never seem to be satisfied. After the months of phony “impeachment” nonsense they put us all through, paid for by dipping into our social security funding, no less, now they’re dead set to cheat their way through the 2020 election. And who better to lead the crooked bandwagon than Little Sally Socialism herself, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.  Cortez is the author of congressional bill OU812 which would place an upper age-limit on legal voting within the United States to 65. After that age, no citizen would be able to register or even visit a local polling place, and all people currently above that mark would be permanently struck from the rolls immediately. The bill is gaining momentum in the Congress and is likely to pass, and with several Republicans in the Senate already beginning to turn against the conservative movement, it stands a good chance of becoming law. Cortez explained the reasoning behind the bill to a crowd gathered outside of her local nail-art emporium in Blumpkinville, New York:  “So, it’s like, old people – a lot of them get kind of dopey, you know? In their minds? They get Demen-entia. Or that really terrible one, Wisenheimer’s. And then they can’t make decisions very well. That’s why we end up with a professional con man like Trump, right? And then we have to go through all this trouble to impeach him and throw him out and fix their mistake, and it’s not fair. So I figure it could be eliminated altogether if we just stop them from voting stupid. They wont know. We can like, send them little pieces of paper, and they can write ‘Trump’ on them and we can just pat their heads and tell them we’ll put it in the voting car and it’ll drive it to the voting house or whatever. They won’t know the difference. Everyone happy. Okay, I have to go because I heard the new line of Hot Emoticon nail art is out and it’s SOOO delish.”  Experts agree that if the bill passes fairly soon, it will nearly destroy President Trump’s voting base and chances for re-election. But then again, experts also agreed that Killery was going to win in 2016, isn’t that right patriots? And you know, she basically did, but only for the grace of the electoral college, designed exactly for that reason by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ Himself. We can only hope and pray that should this bill see the light of day, God will find another way to give America the mentally handicapped President she deserves.  Share this:",FALSE
"The Samoan government has ordered doctors to stop administering a vaccination protecting against the measles, mumps and rubella.  The nation-wide halt was requested after two babies died minutes after receiving the MMR vaccination on July 6.  The babies were rushed to Safotu Hospital in Savai'i but couldn't be saved.  Both the one-year-old girl and boy were killed within minutes of getting the injection stock image  The first baby, a one-year-old girl, died within three minutes of being injected with the vaccine, TV1 Samoa reported.  Two hours later, a second family brought in their one-year-old boy to be vaccinated, but refused to go through with it after hearing about the earlier death.  The nurse allegedly injected the boy without the parents' consent and he died within one minute.  ABOUT THE MEASLES, MUMPS AND RUBELLA SHOT According to the World Health Organisation, countries that use vaccines have almost entirely eradicated diseases such as measles  The MMR vaccine protects against the three diseases of mumps, measles and rubella  It is usually injected in two doses in young children  One injection is about 93% effective, while the two doses are 97% effective at preventing diseases  Child mortality has gone down in many countries that use the vaccines Advertisement  An immediate withdrawal of the vaccine was ordered by Ministry of Health CEO Dr Take Naseri.  A forensic autopsy on the two babies has also been requested. Their deaths are being investigated by police.

"SHARE Madison - Gov. Scott Walker's proposal to increase funding for voucher and public charter schools as well as his plan to create a new stream of funding to allow special-needs children to attend private schools drew immediate criticism Sunday from the state's largest teacher union, public school advocates and a major disability rights group. According to funding proposals unveiled by the governor's office Sunday, Walker is making money available that could be used as incentive payments for teachers and schools based on how well schools perform on state report cards. Walker will propose a modest increase - roughly 1% - in funding for Wisconsin public schools in his budget to the Legislature on Wednesday, two years after his steep cuts and all but elimination of collective bargaining for teachers sparked the unsuccessful movement to recall Walker from office. Tom Beebe, project director for Opportunity to Learn Wisconsin, a liberal-leaning group and former executive director of the Wisconsin Alliance for Excellent Schools, has been critical of Walker's cuts to education. He said the amount of general aid increase proposed for this next biennial budget - $129.2 million over two years - only amounts to about $161 for each of Wisconsin's 800,000 public-school students. ""If the revenue cap does not go up, then there is no new money going to schools no matter how much aid increases,"" Beebe said. ""The increase in school funding simply goes to property-tax payers, not into the classroom."" Mary Bell, president of the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the state's largest teacher union, said the modest increase was really just keeping overall revenue for schools flat. ""The stagnant revenue on top of the largest cuts to education funding in Wisconsin history in the last budget is another clear indication that this governor has no intention of supporting neighborhood schools,"" Bell said in a statement. ""(Walker's) real focus is privatizing public education with another infusion of resources to the unaccountable taxpayer-funded private school voucher program while leaving our neighborhood public schools on life support,"" she added. The Republican-controlled Legislature will review Walker's budget over the next four months and make changes before voting on it sometime in June. The two-year spending plan takes effect in July. State Rep. Sondy Pope, ranking Democrat on the Assembly's Education Committee, said Walker's proposal isn't enough. At the rate of state aid funding for public schools, it would take 12 years to replace the money lost in the last budget, she said. Walker contends schools have been able to save money because the collective bargaining law also required teachers to contribute more toward their pension and health care benefits. The nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance reported in November that those cuts in benefits and limiting union-negotiated raises to the rate of inflation offset about two-thirds of the reductions in school revenue in the 2011-'12 academic year. Pope said the increase in aid Walker is proposing won't be enough to help schools struggling to make ends meet. ""These people are trying to starve Wisconsin public schools,"" she said. Republican Sen. Luther Olsen, chairman of the Senate's Education Committee, said he was glad to see Walker putting more money into public education. ""It's a lot better than having to cut like we did in the last budget,"" he said. ""It's not as much as I wanted, but we're glad it's not negative or zero."" Walker's funding for schools includes $73 million more for voucher schools, $23 million for charter schools, and $21 million in grants for special-needs students to receive a voucher to attend private schools. A proposal for those special-needs vouchers passed the Assembly last session, despite broad opposition from the state Department of Public Instruction, disabilities rights groups, and the state school boards association. It did not pass the Senate. Lisa Pugh, public policy coordinator for Disability Rights Wisconsin, expressed concern that special-needs vouchers were now being proposed as part of the budget, because it would be a significant policy change in the way students with special needs are served. And that should be debated in education legislative committees, she said. Also, the $21 million for special-needs children could have been applied to help public schools across the state, not just for the minority of children who could use that taxpayer subsidy to attend a private school, she said. Walker's plans for expanding the more well-known voucher system encompassing Milwaukee's long-standing program and Racine's new program are highly anticipated, but he did not immediately provide those details. Funding for the UW System would go up $181 million under the budget, two years after it was cut by $315 million. Technical college aid would increase $5 million. UW spokesman David Giroux said the increased funding, coupled with the university being exempted from so-called lapses that could have resulted in $66 million in cuts, was ""very positive."" ""We want to create a stronger workforce for Wisconsin, and new taxpayer investments are essential to that effort,"" Giroux said. ""It looks like we will have enough funding to preserve today's levels of college access and quality, along with new investments in UW programs focused on job creation. That's a smart investment."" Walker is making $64 million available in incentive payments for K-12 schools, tied to their grades on statewide report cards. Of that, $24 million would go to schools with an A or B grade, $30 million would go to schools that show a certain level of improvement on the report cards and $10 million would be available to the lowest-performing districts for a one-time grant if they provide an acceptable improvement plan. Brian Pleva, lobbyist for the American Federation for Children Wisconsin, a conservative group, praised Walker's increase for voucher- and charter-school funding because it would give low-income and middle-class parents more educational choices. He also said that special-needs scholarships would help a minority of families for which local public schools aren't meeting their children's needs. Walker said in a statement Sunday that the budget proposals will reward successes and provide incentives to schools to drive achievement and accountability. In this next biennial budget, total K-12 funding would go up $276 million, according to the AP. But Walker will not lift the lid on revenue limits, saying he was concerned about moves that might cause property taxes to increase. The proposed increase in aid to schools comes after Walker cut general school aid by $834 million two years ago, a more than 8% drop from the previous funding period. To restrict school boards from raising property taxes to replace the drop in school aid, the governor proposed reducing districts' revenue limit authority - the combined amount they're able to raise in local property taxes and state general school aid - by 5.5%. As a result, the average school per-pupil revenue limit dropped about $555 in 2011-'12, from $10,100 in 2010-'11.

"Corbis via Getty Images  Bill Gates, the fourth richest person in the world and a self-described nerd who is known for his early programming skills rather than his love of the outdoors, has been quietly snatching up 242,000 acres of farmland across the U.S. — enough to make him the top private farmland owner in America.  After years of reports that he was purchasing agricultural land in places like Florida and Washington, The Land Report revealed that Gates, who has a net worth of nearly $121 billion according to Forbes, has built up a massive farmland portfolio spanning 18 states. His largest holdings are in Louisiana 69,071 acres, Arkansas 47,927 acres and Nebraska 20,588 acres. Additionally, he has a stake in 25,750 acres of transitional land on the west side of Phoenix, Arizona, which is being developed as a new suburb.  According to The Land Report’s research, the land is held directly and through third-party entities by Cascade Investments, Gates’ personal investment vehicle. Cascade’s other investments include food-safety company Ecolab, used-car retailer Vroom and Canadian National Railway.  While it may be surprising that a tech billionaire would also be the biggest farmland owner in the country, this is not Gates’ only foray into agriculture. In 2008, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation announced $306 million in grants to promote high-yield, sustainable agriculture among smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The foundation has further invested in the development and proliferation of “super crops” resistant to climate change and higher-yield dairy cows. Last year, the organization announced Gates Ag One, a nonprofit to advance those efforts.  It is not entirely clear how Gates’ farmland is being used, or whether any of the land is being set aside for conservation. Cascade did not return Forbes’ request for comment. However, there is some indication that the land could be used in a way that aligns with the foundation’s values. Cottonwood Ag Management, a subsidiary of Cascade, is a member of Leading Harvest, a nonprofit that promotes sustainable agriculture standards that prioritize protections of crops, soil and water resources.  Gates is not the only billionaire on The Land Report’s list of top private farmland owners. Wonderful Company cofounders Stewart and Lynda Resnick net worth: $7.1 billion ranked number three with 190,000 acres. Their farmland produces the goods for their brands including POM Wonderful, Wonderful Pistachios and Wonderful Halos mandarins.  While Gates may be the country’s biggest farmland owner, he by no means is the largest individual landowner. In its list of 100 top American landowners, The Land Report gives the top spot to Liberty Media Chair John Malone, who owns 2.2 million acres of ranches and forests. CNN founder Ted Turner ranked number three with 2 million acres of ranch land across eight states. Even Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is investing in land on a large scale, landing the 25th spot with his ownership of 420,000 acres, mainly in west Texas.",FALSE
"In a pre-taped interview with CNN’s Don Lemon this week, former First Lady and bestselling author and filmmaker Michelle Obama had some surprisingly unladylike things to say about some conservative pundits. The segment, to air Monday, is causing internet hullabaloo as some of the leaked footage went viral.  Lemon began the interview with standard questions, pressing the megastar for her views on current events, ranging from *President Trump’s handling of the pandemic event to the civil unrest brought on by protests surrounding the death of unarmed victim George Floyd by abusive and overzealous racist police officers. Obamawatcher received a sample of the tape from hacktivist Sandra Batt of the New York Daily Queefer:  “What really bothers me are these phony conservative Fox News morons inciting violence and spreading their racism to Trump’s already mentally defective base. Candace Owens, for example. That ‘Aunt Tom’ as I call her for selling out her own people, should be dropped into the middle of an Alabama rodeo.

It’s like all the idiots on Facebook who think MLK was a Republican. People like that are why we have to put instructions on shampoo bottles.”  Michelle’s husband Barack has been making a lot of news lately, so it seems appropriate that Mrs. O would choose to shoot herself into the spotlight now.

"Nation  Feds Seize 19,888 Fake State Driver Licenses Made in China in Chicago O'Hare Airport - ALL Registered to Vote -- ALL Democrat  Why are the Chinese making so many fake U.S. driver licenses? Why are they being shipped to Chicago's O'Hare Airport? Why are ALL the names completely phony; yet ALL are Registered to Vote . . . and Registered as Democrats?  That’s a disturbing little tidbit to discover, especially right before an election, right?  According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the bulk of these fake U.S. IDs flooding into the country come from China and Hong Kong, with the rest coming in from South Korea and the U.K.  Officials in Chicago just confiscated a shipment of these fake IDs totaling nearly 20 thousand.  Of course, the local news media in Chicago doesn’t see a connection to “voter fraud,” but most other people do.  As a matter of fact, it’s the main thing that most people see with just three months before an election.  What emboldens illegal voters more than to head to the polls with a phony ID in their pocket in case anyone asks for ID?  From Fox Five Federal customs officers have seized 1,513 shipments from overseas containing fraudulent documents—19,888 counterfeit U.S. driver’s licenses—just at Chicago O’Hare International Airport this year through the end of June. Most of the shipments came from Hong Kong and mainland China, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Other shipments came from South Korea and the U.K. “These counterfeit driver’s licenses can lead to disastrous consequences,” CBP’s Ralph Piccirilli said in a statement. “Criminal organizations use these counterfeit IDs to avoid attracting attention to their illegal activities.” […] “What is most disconcerting about these interceptions, besides the volume in which we are experiencing, is the ease in which so many young people freely share their personal information with counterfeiters abroad,” Lemaux said in a statement. “We’ll continue to collaborate with local law enforcement to educate the public, and anyone who is contemplating purchasing a counterfeit ID online, on the potential dangers of sharing your personal, identifiable information with a criminal element.”  These, they caught.    Makes you wonder how many slipped through the cracks?  Oh, and how is it that that ALL of these phony names are ALL registered to vote and ALL registered as Democrats?  HAL TURNER COMMENTARY  I think that we need to really think outside of the box and be open to *anything* in terms of cheating or interference, because the Dems simply can’t lose this election, and they’ll work with anyone, anywhere to help squeak out a victory.

"0 SHARES Share Tweet BLM pasted these “rules” for “white folks” attending protests on social media. Many whites wanted to stand in unity with their fellow blacks to protest the unjust killing of George Floyd’s. In a moment of unity, these rules seem more degrading and racist towards white people. Among some of the rules, they request whites to “stay in the back until you are called forward. If you hear “White people to the front” or “Allies to the front” step forward and link arms with other white people to form a human shield.” So they asked that all whites stay in the back and link arms with other whites, not blacks. Seems those that are crying for equality don’t want equality, they want superiority over whites. Unity is when we unite side by side together in a common goal. So why would they not use this moment to show that we can all one? BLM Mohawk Kuzma said this in 2014: “As organizer of the largest Black Lives Matter marches in Seattle since 2014, Mohawk Kuzma has had a front-row seat to the transforming demographics of the BLM movement. He says that my eyes are not deceiving me. There is a noticeable increase of white marchers, one that he says signifies that white Seattleites’ long hibernation on Black issues is at its end. “The reason BLM marches are getting more white is because more white people are waking up and seeing the covert segregation and racial injustice and racism,” Kuzma tells me. “We see it on the news every day across the nation.” He draws a connection with the overt displays of racism, from pervasive police killings of blacks to the recent domestic terrorist acts by white supremacists, most recently a school shooting by one in New Mexico Kuzma says that when he began organizing he welcomed whatever race, gender, or orientation felt compelled to attend, as long as the marchers understood “that all black lives matter and racial injustice, police brutality, and racism needed to stop.” However, he also recognizes that the increased numbers of white folks is a double-edged sword. “More white people also brings white ignorance and white fragility,” he says. “White people think they have to be respectful during a protest. Sorry, but we as black people don’t get respect from anyone, including white people, so why should we be respectful. We are here to get stuff done.” During the Civil War, it was white people that fought for the freedom of slaves. At that time the north had 22 million people against slavery while the south had 9 million. 4 million of them were slaves. It was white people that ran the underground railroad. It has always true that more white people are fighting for equal rights than not. Though many seem to want to overlook this historical fact. This movement is an American movement and we should have mutual respect for each other. We should treat each other how we expect to be treated.

"Governor Andrew Cuomo is considering a temporary six-week ban on the sale of combustible cigarettes in order to reduce the State’s Coronavirus death count, a source familiar with his thinking tells The Chronicle. The ban could come as soon as Monday and is expected to be included in a budget measure already scheduled to be announced.  New data out of Italy suggest that the nation’s whopping Coronavirus death rate — now approaching 10% of those who test positive — is highly correlated to cigarette use. Italian men smoke cigarettes at rates that far outpace most other developed countries, and the extreme shortage of ventilators there has been the cause of death for tens of thousands of smokers.  According to Italy’s National Health Institute, smokers with COVID-19 were one-third more likely to have a serious clinical situation than non-smokers. Half of these smokers required a ventilator.  For many weeks, it was observed that women in Italy are better able to overcome the virus than men. Italian doctors now believe that the statistical difference is attributable to smoking-related gender norms.  COVID-19 kills its victims by compromising the respiratory system and reducing oxygen levels in the blood. Regular cigarette use damages the airways and small air sacs in the lungs. Combustible cigarettes weaken smokers’ lungs by filling them with smoke and tar.  “When a smoker contracts COVID-19, he or she will be far more likely to suffer respiratory system failure, thereby exacerbating New York’s ventilator shortage,” Cuomo plans to say in remarks prepared for Monday. “Fortunately, medical science informs us that ex-smokers experience significant recovery in lung function and oxygen absorption as soon as they quit smoking.”  Former smokers recover 30% of their lung function just two weeks after quitting.  “Any ex-smoker can tell you how, just days after quitting, they were noticeably less out of breath after walking up a flight of stairs. Personally, I have heard hundreds of these stories,” he writes in draft remarks.  Dr. Howard Zucker, the Commissioner of Health, is prodding Cuomo to issue the temporary ban and discussed the issue with him privately earlier this week. Zucker has long advocated for additional restrictions on combustible cigarette sales, which causes more than 443,000 deaths annually — more deaths each year than from murder, car accidents, alcohol or drug use, suicides, and HIV combined.  It’s estimated that 81,000 people will die from COVID-19.  Zucker argues that a ban on cigarette sales for the duration of the outbreak will save thousands of lives and will reduce the State’s shortage of ventilators, perhaps by several thousand during its peak — expected to hit the State 21 days from today.  Therefore, the Governor’s advisors postulate, if New York takes immediate action and temporarily bans combustible cigarette sales during this public health crisis, ex-smokers’ respiratory systems will make significant recovery at the very same time that COVID-19 cases are peaking in New York.  “This will save lives, and not just the lives of smokers,” the Governor plans to say. “Every former smoker that gets sick, but does not need a ventilator, means one more ventilator is available to keep our aging parents and grandparents alive.”  “Importantly, we must also recognize that failing to temporarily ban combustible cigarettes immediately will cause a disproportionate increase in COVID-19 fatalities in minority communities, given the higher prevalence of immuno-deficiencies in these communities,” he plans to note.  The Governor’s supporters argue that it is more important now than ever to address the public health cost of combustible cigarettes — not just to save the lives of smokers, but to save the lives of all New Yorkers by mitigating the severity of a ventilator shortage.

"DREAM Act applications roll in while Excelsior Scholarship applications are suspended by One Party Rule in New York  ALBANY, NY – The New York State Senate Republican Conference today slammed Democrats who have kept applications granting free tuition to illegal immigrants open while closing the Excelsior Scholarship application available to citizen students, whose families are struggling even more due to forced business closures during the coronavirus pandemic.  “Time and time again, Democrats show New Yorkers their true priorities and under One Party Rule, illegal immigrants come before hardworking, law-abiding New Yorkers. When Senate Democrats voted to create free tuition for illegal immigrants, Republicans said no. To add insult to injury, so many families are facing an even more dire financial hardship after Governor Cuomo forced their livelihoods shut. To close citizen students out of the application process while continuing to give illegal immigrants free tuition is ludicrous. New Yorkers shouldn’t be funding tuition for illegal immigrants at all, and we should be closing down that program permanently as we look to find savings in our budget,” said Senate Republican Leader Rob Ortt.  Tuition for SUNY schools is due in August, leaving parents nervous as they check the still closed application page.  “Middle class, law-abiding, taxpaying parents are struggling right now. They and their children deserve answers. New York State should not be playing politics with their futures,” said Senator Pam Helming.  “If anyone ever needed a crystal clear example of the Senate Democrat’s ‘Bizzaro World’ priorities that put illegal immigrants first and hardworking, law-abiding taxpayers dead last, look no further than this latest shameful policy. In January 2019, Senate Democrats rammed through their so-called ‘DREAM Act’ giving free college to illegal immigrants. I voted no and said their DREAM Act was a nightmare for taxpayers to the tune of $27 million annually. Now in July 2020, Senate Democrats show they’ve learned nothing as they’re shamefully keeping open applications granting free tuition to illegal immigrants while closing Excelsior Scholarship applications to citizen students, many of whom have families that are financially reeling due to the Coronavirus outbreak. This latest policy hypocrisy shows that the Senate Democrats continue catering to their illegal immigrant base while law-abiding taxpayers get another slap in the face,” said Senator Daphne Jordan.  “There may be disagreement as to whether those who are here illegally should be getting the benefits of legal citizens, but there should be no disagreement that state government should not be discriminating against citizen students and their families who are part of the Excelsior Program and who are anxiously waiting for their tuition relief applications to be processed. Every legislator took an oath of office to represent the interests of the legal citizens of this state and nation and they will have to answer to those voters in November if they fail to uphold that oath,” said Senator Jim Tedisco.  “We have law-abiding, hardworking families across the Southern Tier and Finger Lakes regions struggling to make ends meet, paying outrageously high state and local taxes, and going into huge amounts of debt trying to afford college for their children. It’s not right to ignore the needs and the hopes of these families while we turn around and continue to deliver hard-earned taxpayer dollars to provide free college tuition for illegal immigrant families,” said Senator Tom O’Mara.  “The thousands of New York students who have been shut out of this application process with no explanation from the state deserve immediate answers. Countless New Yorkers are facing unprecedented economic hardship as a result of state actions and now the state is just adding insult to injury by leaving them in this limbo. It is absolutely unacceptable and the state needs to get its priorities in order,” said Senator Sue Serino.  “Only in NYC-Democrat-ruled New York would you send law-abiding, taxpaying families to the back of the line while giving illegal immigrants preferential treatment when it comes to college tuition aid. Every parent and student who was counting on the Excelsior Scholarship for the fall semester and is now desperately worrying about how to pay the August bill deserves an explanation as to why they’ve been put on hold while applications and aid are flowing for illegal immigrants seeking a free college education at taxpayer expense. It’s outrageous, unfair, and it symbolizes everything that’s wrong in Albany under One Party Rule,” said Senator George M. Borrello.  “Many New Yorkers have suffered and continue to experience significant challenges as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. While I believe access to a quality education is important, we should not be prioritizing one segment of the state’s population, especially during this difficult time. Our focus must be on providing assistance to the state’s hardworking residents, families, business owners, and taxpayers who are struggling,” said Senator Joe Griffo.  “Senate Democrats have been clear about their priorities since day one – those that break the rules come first and those that follow the rules take a back seat. Senate Republicans have always stood with law-abiding citizens and this case is no exception,” said Senator Rich Funke.  “It is unconscionable that Democrats would punish students whose only crime is that they are citizens. It is no wonder that hard-working New York families are leaving the state in droves,” said Senator Andrew Lanza.  ###",partially false

GETTY Critics have urged the Government to step up efforts to deport foreign offenders “Any EU national who uses freedom of movement rights to come to the UK must abide by our laws and contribute to society. “It is clear, given the longevity of many of these sentences, a worryingly high number of the offences committed were of a severe nature. “The public rightly expect foreign criminals to be deported back to their own country once convicted, rather than being kept in British prisons at our expense. “It is a disgrace that EU rules often weaken the UK Government’s ability to deport these criminals. This is a clear example of EU membership working against the public interest. “The fact many EU citizens are able to enter the UK despite having prior convictions is incredibly worrying. “It is vital to ensure the safety of the public and vigorous checks must be carried out on all EU nationals entering the United Kingdom. “After Brexit, and during the implementation period, the Government must ensure there are stringent new controls on EU immigration to prevent potential criminals entering Britain in the first place, as well as speeding up the process of deportation once convicted.” The world's most notorious prisons Fri, June 17, 2016 Rival gangs share cells, inmates and police clash, here are the most dangerous prisons in the world.

"Here’s something your doctor, or Oncologist will never tell you. If you have cancer, then you have fungus/mold/candida. It feeds the cancer, it is cancer itself. Here’s all you need to know and how to deal with it.  Few things are scarier than hearing the words, “you have cancer.” And yet it’s something that an estimated one third, to half the population will hear at least once in their lifetime.  With such staggering rates and so much money and research poured into combating cancer, you would think we would have rounded the corner towards reducing it, or even found a cure by now. What is terrifying is that despite the millions of dollars spent every year on research, we seem to be no closer to knowing exactly what causes cancer, much less finding a cure for it.  But step away from the mainstream noise for a moment and listen to what many health professionals have understood for some time now. As more and more professors and Doctors are making the link between cancer and something else we all suffer from and that’s fungus. We would even go so far as to say cancer is a fungus. They are one and the same.  These findings are covered over  The Data is building. It’s just not been shouted about loudly enough and the voices of the many professionals that have been shouting this from the roof tops have remained more or less unheard. Whilst research papers have been ignored and down played.  For me, cancer often epitomizes the phrase, “etiology unknown.” As the root causes of cancer are never pinned down and gets ignored. Some factors remain to be seen as contributing, such as Genetics, yet in most cases the traits tend to to be more habitual than genetic. And yet, it’s actually less of a mystery than is made out, as by and large, we can see why some people get cancer and others do not.  We can narrow down the contributing factors to one or more of the following: a compromised immune system, poor diet, poor drinking water, smoking, alcoholism, substance abuse, heavy metal toxicity, asbestos poisoning, radiation, or chemicals…. Yet the main factor throughout all cases of cancer is the presence of infestations of fungus in the body.  In fact, it’s not even a new discovery and dates back to Victorian times, yet the fact remains that fungi and their mycotoxins are not as well understood by mainstream medical science as we hoped by now they would be. It’s just not a popular topic and not enough is openly discussed about this hidden killer.  It is unsurprising that any doctor would roll his eyes at the idea of a link between cancer and fungus. Yet did a little and you will discover there are many published papers throughout medical literature describing the very profound role that fungus plays in the development of cancer. So excuse the pun, but fungus has been left in the dark too long.  Let’s shed some light on fungus  Fungi produces chemical by-products as part of its natural life cycle. These chemicals are often toxic, in which case they are known as “mycotoxins”. These mycotoxins are among the most toxic, naturally occurring chemicals on earth. For example, one mycotoxin known as aflatoxin is a carcinogenic mycotoxin known to cause liver cancer. Other mycotoxins are known to be genotoxic and mutagenic and it’s well published that certain mycotoxins cause cancer.  It’s in our food  What people do not realize is that these mycotoxins are known to contaminate parts of our food supply, particularly grain and corn thus must be avoided. Knowing the huge scope those foods play in the global diet and the frequency with which most people consume those foods, the chances are that most people are regularly consuming mycotoxins. Especially the standard American diet of fast and processed foods.  Furthermore, it is published that certain fungi can actually mimic types of cancer in the body!  Certain fungal species produce a sac, or ascomycete, that on close inspection looks just like cancer cells. Just last year in a European medical journal, doctors found conclusive evidence that a breast cancer tumor was actually a sac fungus.  “The likelihood,” they stated,” that the tumor was not fungal in origin, is low.”  Breast cancer is fungus  And this is also what our team found, whilst undertaking a 2 year study in autopsy and that is that ALL breast cancers, when placed under a dark field microscope, are in fact identified as fungus, not cancer, this is where our research really did begin.  So what does this say to you? Surely this should concern us all.  As a cancer patient, you may have received a lot of information about your treatment and your journey to recovery. That Chemotherapy and radiation cause many changes in the body as they destroy the cancer cells.  And of course, one of these major changes is to your immune system. Just as you need it the most. Your now weakened immune system increases your chances of getting an infection, including, of course, any fungal infections. As we have just stated, everyone without exception with cancer has fungus, this is more than just a coincidence.  Some statistics  The numbers are staggering. Some eight million people die every year from cancer worldwide, with more than half a million in the United States alone. The global number is predicted to rise to twelve million by 2030.    Cancer is the biggest cause of death for people under 85 and in the US one in four people die from cancer – one in four. In the UK the government stated that one in every two people alive today will have cancer at some point. These figures are on the increase not decline.  And then when you look at the rise in Fungus levels, in pollution, with poor quality water, phosphate fertilizers in our food, as well as many other environmental issues. It’s no surprise the rate of cancer is set to increase, not decrease.  Sugar fuels fungus  Sugars and wheat products are a great source of fuel to any fungus. Imagine, one grain of sugar gives enough fuel for that fungus to grow quickly and establish itself.  Most people suffer from fungus in their toes and toe nails, an area of the body that can can be seen by the naked eye, but fungus can live in every living cell of your body including your skin cells. Symptoms of rash etc often are not shown until the fungus is out of control.  In August 9th, 1969 a man named Dr Richard Day, who was at the time head of the Rockerfeller controlled eugenics organization Planned Parenting, addressed a meeting of doctors in Pittsburgh about the approach of of globalisation and how this would change our lives forever. He asked the attending doctors to turn off their recording equipment, to not take notes on what he was about to say. Before he went on to detail a long list of planned changes. One doctor did take notes, however and later talked publicly about what was said.    Now, 40 years later, we can actually see how extraordinarily accurate Dr Day was, as he said: “We can cure almost every cancer RIGHT NOW. Information is on file in the Rockefeller Institute, if it’s ever decided that it should be released.” Yet, letting people die of cancer would “slow down population growth.” And that “You may as well die of cancer, as something else.”    Curing cancer is bad for business  Big Pharma has no desire to cure cancer when it is making vast fortunes from treating the symptoms with devastating drugs and cell-killing, people-killing poisons like chemotherapy. And it is not even primarily about money. It’s about population overgrowth and control. He who holds the purse strings owns the power.  Doctor Simoncini and Candida  An Italian doctor Tullio Simoncini, is a brilliant and courageous man who has refused to bow to such enormous pressure. He personally has faced and continues to face an unimaginable amount of amount of stress after he realized what cancer really is and how it can be dealt with.    Simoncini’s ‘crime’ has been to discover that cancer is actually a fungus caused by Candida, a yeast-like organism that lives in the body in small amounts, even in healthy people. The immune system normally keeps it under control, but when the Candida morphs into a powerful fungus some serious health problems can follow, often in the form of cancer.      In fact Simoncini says that cancer is Candida fungal infection and that the conventional medical explanation of cancer as a cellular malfunction is plain wrong.. And we at Healing Oracle have to agree.  Candida  From the time he entered medicine he realized that something was seriously wrong with the way cancer was treated:  “I saw terrible sufferings. I was in a paediatric oncological ward – all the children died. I was suffering when I was looking at the poor, poor children dying with chemo, with radiation.”  And It was this that led him to search for new ways to understand and treat this devastating disease.  Simoncini realized that all cancers acted the same way, no matter where they were in the body, or even what form they took. He searched for a common denominator. He also observed that the cancer ‘lumps’ were always white. Simoncini realized thatacted the same way, no matter where they were in the body, or even what form they took. He searched for a common denominator. He also observed that the cancer ‘lumps’ were always white.  Cancer cells are white  I was fortunate enough to take a 2 year study in autopsy, where it was confirmed, without any doubt at all, that ALL patients that died with cancer had fungus in more than one part of the body. What else is white? Candida.    So what if Mainstream medicine believes cancer to be simply cell growth going wild, or “cancerous growth,” actually the immune system producing cells to defend the body from Candida attack and the sequence goes like this:  In a healthy body, Candida is kept under control by the immune system, but when that becomes undermined and weakened, so the Candida can expand and build a “colony.” This colony, eventually penetrates an organ and the immune system has to respond to the threat in another way. It builds a defensive barrier of cells around the colony and this growth becomes a lump in the body and becomes identified as “cancer”. The spread of this cancer is then triggered by the Candida fungus, escaping. Often due to a biopsy, or surgery, where the protective barrier of cells is pierced open and the candida is set free to spread elsewhere in the body.      The immune system  So if it’s the immune system that contains the Candida, so it seems as there has been a calculated war on this very system. A silent war that has gained strength over time and become more vociferous with every decade.  The immune system is weakened and attacked by food and drink additives, chemical farming, vaccinations , frequencies, pharmaceutical drugs, the stress of modern ‘life’ and so much more.  Cure Candida with Ozone  Ozone is the number one cure for fungus moulds and pathogens. Ordinary Oxygen molecules consist of only two atoms. The third atom in Ozone only stays attached until it can react with, or oxidize, another substance. If that substance is a bacteria cell or fungi, it’s doomed; the spare oxygen atoms in the ambient ozone attach to the cell walls of microorganisms and crack them open.  Ozone machines  Ozone is a naturally occurring gas created from oxygen atoms. Ozone-disinfecting systems have become popular for people wishing to clean fruit and vegetables, for keeping rooms and hot tubs clean and have been around for several years.  Oxygen is harvested from the air filtering out nitrogen and moisture to get pure oxygen, which is then passed through Corona discharge cells, which deliver a jolt of electricity that turns the O2 into O3. The process leaves oxygen and nitrogen, which is environmentally safe.  The oxygen molecule is made up of 2 oxygen atoms. These oxygen molecules are broken into atoms by the ‘corona discharge’ during lightning storms, or by UV light from the Sun. Single oxygen atoms cannot exist alone without regrouping back into di-atomic  oxygen molecules. During this recombination stage some atoms will regroup into loosely bonded tri-atomic oxygen. This new molecule is called Ozone, as seen to the right d = 1.28 A, Theta = 116.5o. Due to the loose bond in this oxygen molecule – ozone is a very strong oxidant and an ideal chemical-free purification and a disinfecting agent.  Ozone is frequently misdiagnosed and equated to low-altitude pollution. Nothing could be farther from the truth. In fact, Ozone breaks down pollutants and should be welcomed when found in the air. The most effective way to produce Ozone commercially is through the use of pulse injected corona discharge. Disinfection by tri-atomic oxygen Ozone occurs through the rupture of the cell wall. An ozone level of 0.  4 ppm for 4 minutes has been shown to kill any bacteria, virus, mould and fungus.  Ozonated Water  Use Ozone to disinfect both water and the bottles you drink from. Drink 4oz of Ozonated water daily.  Ozone IV  Ozone can be administered via I.V to a patient 3 times a week and up-to 90ml for 2 weeks to ensure all fungus is gone.  For feet candida we suggest Hyperbaric Ozone boots.      Disclaimer  This is a very delicate procedure and should never be attempted at home. Always consult with a fully trained medical professional who fully understands all aspects of Ozone therapy and the risks involved if it is not administered, or monitored correctly.  So if cancer is fungus, is there a common, natural way to kill it and stop it spreading? Well the answer is actually in most people’s kitchen cupboard.  SODIUM BICARBONATE Yes, the main ingredient in good old Baking Soda whilst of course baking soda, contains other ingredients, it’s the Sodium Bicarbonate itself that provides the solution. In fact, it’s such a powerful weapon against fungus, unlike any synthesised drugs, the Candida simply cannot ‘adapt’ to it.  How it works  The patient is given Sodium bicarbonate orally and internally via an endoscope a long thin camera tube, used to see inside the body which allows the Sodium bicarbonate to be placed directly on the cancer fungus itself. Preventing any growth and killing the candida infestation.  Dr Simocini’s many successes have been down played and no clinical trials conducted. It’s a relatively simple and cheap solution and yet all this time millions of people are dying from cancers that could have been treated easily and effectively.  Understanding Salvestrols  In April 2017, two British scientists and researchers, Professor Gerry Potter of the Cancer Drug Discovery Group and Professor Dan Burke published a newsletter. Their combined findings reveal the following:  Cancer cells have a unique ‘biomarker’ that normal cells do not, an enzyme called CYP1B1 pronounced sip-one-bee-one. Enzymes are proteins that ‘catalyze’ increase the rate of chemical reactions.    Organic Fruit and veg  The CYP1B1 alters the chemical structure of something called Salvestrols that are found naturally in many fruit and vegetables. This chemical change turns the salvestrols into an agent that kills cancer cells, but does not harm healthy cells.  The synchronicity is perfect. The CYP1B1 enzyme appears only in cancer cells and it reacts with salvestrols in fruit and vegetables to create a chemical substance that kills only cancer cells.  Salvestrols is the natural defence system found in fruit and vegetables and especially those that are subject to fungus damage. And alarmingly, the chemical fungicide sprays used in modern farming, only artificially kills fungus, which means the plants and crops do not have to trigger their own defence mechanism salvestrols. And so this is why only organic and non GMO foods contain the Salevestrols your body needs to fight cancer.  In fact, the most widely-used fungicides are such powerful blockers of CYP1B1 that if you eat enough chemically-produced food it wouldn’t matter how many salvestrols you then consumed, they are no longer effective as the cancer-destroying agent they are designed to be.  More on the effects of fungus  The biggest cause of fungus is on our feet. We bathe or shower and forget about our feet, that serve us so well. It is important to lift each foot to wash and thoroughly dry them. Wearing open toe shoes as much as possible to allow your feet to breath.  Sneakers should only be worn for training, not for everyday purpose. Sprinkling bicarbonate of soda on your feel after drying is very helpful. Dead skin builds up on the feet, becoming bacteria and fungus.  Removing all dead skin from feet is extremely important.Expose feet as much as possible. Make friends with your feet, become well antiquated and give them some love.  We suggest Ozonation of feet in bad cases for a speedy recovery.  Fungus infections can vary significantly Some fungal infections are mild skin rashes, but others can be deadly, like fungal pneumonia. Because of this, it’s important to eradicate any fungus as soon as possible to try to avoid serious infection.  Fungal infections can look like bacterial or viral nfections. Which is a very common mistake and the resulting antibiotics are ineffective and can lead to gut flora issues later down the line.  The type of cancer you have can affect your risk. If you have a blood cancer like leukemia or myeloma, you may be at an even greater risk of further fungal infection than people with other types of cancer.  Your risk of infection can change based on the strength of your chemotherapy. Aggressive chemotherapy completely depletes your immune system and can put you at risk of getting a fungal infection that will fuel the cancer.  Your hospital stay matters. The longer you are in hospital the greater the risk of fungal infection due the hospitals heating system running at temperatures perfect for breading fungus, bacteria and infection.  Where you live geography matters. Some disease-causing fungi are more common in certain parts of the world. If you live in, or visit these areas and have cancer you may be more likely to get these infections than the general population. Humidity also promote fungus and bacteria.  Preventing fungal infections in cancer patients. Fungi are difficult but not impossible to avoid because they are a natural part of the environment. It lives outdoors, in soil, on plants, trees and other vegetation. They are also on many indoor surfaces and on your skin. However, there may be some ways for you to lower the chances of getting an infection, including a serious fungal infection.  Know if your white blood cell count is low. Having a very low white blood cell count can put you at greater risk of infection and fungus.  Protect yourself from the environment. As you start to recover from the effects of As you start to recover from the effects of chemotherapy and start doing your normal activities again, there are some ways to lower the chances of getting a serious fungal infection by trying to avoid disease-causing fungi in the environment:  Try to avoid areas with a lot of dust like construction, or excavation sites.  Stay inside during dust storms.  Stay away from areas with bird and bat droppings. This includes places like chicken coops and caves.  Wear gloves when handling materials such as soil, moss, or manure.  Wear long pants, and a long-sleeved shirt when doing outdoor activities such as gardening, yard work, or visiting wooded areas and completely wash and dry your feet after walks.  Using 1 cup of apple cider vinegar or half a cup of bicarbonate of soda in a bath tub, or bucket for feet will stop fungus growing.  dehumidifiers in the home will take help take out moisture in the room.  Vacuum AC units every 2 weeks and lightly spray air conditioner filters with apple cider vinegar solution, 1 cup to 1 ltr of water  Don’t forget to do the same with your vehicle.    Cancer-Fungus and the Connection  Another link between fungi and cancer is their relationship with sugar and Gluten. Healthy cells in our bodies use glucose and oxygen to produce ATP adenosine triphosphate, which is the main source of energy for cell functions. Cancer cells, on the other hand, use fermentation to produce ATP. Fermentation does not use oxygen and is, in general, a very inefficient way to produce energy. Cancer cells must consume large amounts of sugar in order to survive and grow.  Cancer cells love fungus and fungus thrives on sugar and gluten. What is the first thing you do when candida gets out of control? That’s right ? lay off the sugar and simple carbs like bread and pasta.  In addition, growing fungi produce chemicals called mycotoxins, which have played some part in the development of cancer in humans according to experimental data. The connection between mycotoxins and cancer lies in its ability to effect the protein production within cells. For example, it can effect protein 53, a protein that, when healthy, can activate other proteins that repair DNA.  According to Dr. Lynn Jennings, family practitioner and medical writer: “A defective p53 protein could allow abnormal cells to proliferate, resulting in cancer. As many as 50% of all human tumors contain p53 mutations.”  If Cancer is a Fungus, Lets Treat it Like a Fungus  Dr. A.V. Constantini, retired head of the World Health Organization’s center for mycotoxins in food, believes that an anti-fungal cancer medication may be just over the horizon. Over the last decades, there has been some anecdotal evidence to support this prediction.  Dr. Simoncini, on the other hand is more doubtful because of the basic nature of fungi itself. “They are social elements,” he says. “They network and they will adapt.”  Dr. Simoncini’s solution to heal cancer naturally is simple. It adheres to the basic principles of natural cancer therapies and to my 7 Essentials ™ System, an evidence-based approach to support and heal the body naturally: change the internal environment in the body from one of acidity which cancer cells love to alkalinity.  Dr. Simoncini recommends the use of sodium bicarbonate therapy. Because the most effective way to shrink tumors is through direct contact with the sodium bicarbonate, in most cases a catheter is used to go through the arteries to the organs within the body.  For some cancers, including breast cancer, a simple local infiltration or injection can be used instead. Dr. Simoncini himself claims that this method carries a 99% success rate for healing breast cancer without surgery.  One can also enjoy an alkaline Sodium bicarbinate drink every day. In a glass of purified water, add the juice of ½ lemon and 1 teaspoon sodium bicarbonate. Stir and enjoy. Because this is such an alkaline drink, always consume it 30 minutes before and at least two hours after a meal as proper digestion requires an acidic pH in the stomach.  In order to prevent breast cancer naturally, be aware of the signs and follow a healthy anti-cancer regime that includes the anti-fungus diet, herbal supplementation, detoxing, emotional healing, biological dentistry, energy balancing and early detection. Maintaining the proper alkaline balance in your body is key to keeping fungal growth ? and breast cancer ? at bay.  There has yet to be discovered any antibiotic that is truly effective in the virus arena. There are indications that DNA viruses such as Herpes are  implicated in human cancers, since they organize the genetic material of the host cell to produce new viruses. Ozone will inactivate viruses on contact, even at very low residual concentrations. In case of polio, only 0.012 ppm removes all viral cells in less than 10 seconds.  Mold, fungus and mildew are easily controlled by Ozone presenting air and in water. Giardia and Cryptosporidium cysts are susceptible to Ozone but not affected by normal levels of Chlorine. The Effects of Ozone on Pathogens The antipathogenic effects of ozone have been substantiated for several decades.  Its killing action upon bacteria, viruses, fungi, and in many species of protozoa, serve as the basis for its increasing use in disinfecting municipal water supplies in cities worldwide.  Bacteria are microscopically small single-cell creatures having a primitive structure. They take up foodstuffs and release metabolic products, and multiply by division. The bacteria body is sealed by a relatively solid cell membrane. Their vital processes are controlled by a complex enzymatic system.  Ozone interferes with the metabolism of bacterium cells, most likely through inhibiting and blocking the operation of the enzymatic control system. A sufficient amount of ozone breaks through the cell membrane, and this leads to the destruction of the bacteria. Viruses are small, independent particles, built of crystals and macromolecules. Unlike bacteria, they multiply only within the host cell. Ozone destroys viruses by diffusing through the protein coat into the nucleic acid core, resulting in damage of the viral RNA.  At higher concentrations, ozone destroys the capsid or exterior protein shell by oxidation. Indicator bacteria in effluents, namely coliformas and  pathogens such as Salmonella, show marked sensitivity to ozone inactivation. Other bacterial organisms susceptible to ozone’s disinfecting properties include:  Streptococci, Shigella, legionella pneumophila, Pseudomonas aerunginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica, Campylobacter jejuni, Mycobacteria, Kelbsiella, pneumonia, and Escherichia coli. Ozone destroys both aerobic and importantly, anaerobic bacteria which are mostly responsible for the devastating sequel of complicated infections, as exemplified by decubitus ulcers and gangrene. The mechanisms of ozone bacterial destruction need to be further elucidated.  It is known that the cell enveloped of bacteria are made of polysaccharides and proteins and that in Gram negative organisms, fatty acid alkyl chains and helical lipoproteins are present. In acid-fast bacteria, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, on third to one half of the capsule is formed of complex lipids esterified mycolic acid, in addition to normal fatty acids, and glycolipids sulfolipids, lipopolysaccharides, mycosides, trehalose mycolates. The high lipid content of the cell walls of these ubiquitous bacteria may explain their sensitivity, and eventual demise, subsequent to ozone exposure. Ozone may also penetrate the cellular envelope, directly affecting cytoplasmic integrity, disrupting any one of numerous levels of its metabolic complexities.  Numerous families of viruses including poliovirus I and 2, human rotavruses, Norwalk virus, Parvoviruses, and Hepatitis A, B and non-A non-B?, among many others, are susceptible to the virucidal actions of ozone. Most research efforts on ozone’s virucidal effects have centered upon ozone’s propensity to break apart lipid molecules at sites of multiple bond configuration. Indeed, once the lipid envelope of the virus is fragmented, its DNA or RNA core cannot survive.  Non-enveloped viruses Adenoviridae, Picornaviridae, namely poliovirus, Coxsachie, Echovirus, Rhinovirus, Hepatitis A and E, and Reoviridae Rotavirus, have also begun to be studied. Viruses that do not have an envelope are called “naked viruses.” They are constituted of a nucleic acid core made of DNA or RNA and a nucleic acid coat, or capsid, made of protein. Ozone, however, aside from its well-recognized action upon unsaturated lipids, can also interact with certain proteins and their constituents, namely amino acids. Indeed, when ozone comes in contact with capsid proteins, protein hydroxides and protein hydroxides and protein hydroperoxides are formed. Viruses have no protections against oxidative stress. Normal mammalian cells, on the other hand possess complex systems of enzymes i.e., superoxide dismutase, catalase, peroxidase, which tend to ward off the nefarious effects of free radical species and oxidative challenge. It may thus be possible to treat infected tissues with ozone, respecting the homeostasis derived from their natural defences, while neutralizing offending and attacking pathogen devoid of similar defences.  The enveloped viruses are usually more sensitive to physico-chemical challenges than are naked virions. Although ozone’s effects upon unsaturated lipids is one of its best documented iochemical action, ozone is known to interact with proteins, carbohydrates, and nucleic acids. This becomes especially relevant when ozone inactivation of non-enveloped virions is considered.  Fungi families inhibited and destroyed by exposure to ozone include Candida, Aspergilus, Histoplasma, Actinomycoses, and Cryptococcus. The walls of fungi are multilayered and re composed of approximately 80% carbohydrates and 10% of proteins and glycoproteins. The presence of many disulfide bonds had been noted, making this a possible site for oxidative inactivation by ozone. In all likelihood, however, ozone has the capacity to diffuse through the fungal wall into the organismic cytoplasm, thus disrupting cellular organelles. Protozoan organisms disrupted by ozone include Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and free-living amoebas, namely Acanthamoeba, Hartmonella, and Negleria. The anit-protozoal action has yet to be elucidated.

Some of the most common causes of this type of infection are dirt, pollution, accumulated sweat as a result of wearing very tight socks and shoes for a longer period of time and walking in dirty water during rainy season. Not washing and ignoring them can lead to harmful consequences.  Here are 7 home remedies you can try to treat toenail fungus.  Tea tree oil contains antifungal and antiseptic abilities, which is very effective in fighting against toenail fungus. Apply few drop of the tea tree oil directly onto the affected nail with a cotton swab. Repeat this twice daily.  Both apple cider vinegar and white vinegar are considered as powerful home remedies to get rid of fungal infections because of its acidic properties.  Soak the infected nail in one part vinegar and two parts warm water for up to 20 minutes everyday. After that, rinse off with water.  Like tea tree oil, garlic, which is a staple in most kitchens, too has antifungal and antimicrobial properties. You can treat toenail fungus by placing crushed garlic cloves on the affected area for half an hour.  Then after it becomes dry, rinse off with water.  Real Organic Honey helps kill fungus and bacteria by flushing out toxins from the body as it contains hydrogen peroxide. Take a tablespoon of honey and apply it on the toenail. Keep for half an hour and then wash off with water. Repeat this twice on a daily basis.  You can use baking soda not only to treat nail fungus, but also to eliminate foot odour. You need to prepare a mixture for this:  Take a bowl and pour 4 cups of hot water, half cup of baking soda, one-fourth cup of hydrogen peroxide and half cup of Epsom salt.  Mix these ingredients properly and add one-fourth cup of white vinegar. Soak the infected nail",FALSE

"Socialist politicians in the Democratic Party have tried for years to eliminate Social Security, a source of income relied upon by millions in this country just to get by in their old age. Why they would pursue this is quite simple – they think of nobody but themselves. Their retirement income is guaranteed through fat congressional pensions in addition to the billions they steal from the taxpayer during their terms in office, so they have no worries.  Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, today launched their latest attack on our beloved social safety net:  “Seniors in this country are soft! They actually rely on this pittance from the government in their latter years! Well guess what, people? This country is in trouble!

"A record number of people killed themselves in prisons in England and Wales in 2016, figures show. The Ministry of Justice said there were 119 self-inflicted deaths - 29 more than the previous year and the highest number since records began in 1978. It also reported a record high of 37,784 self-harm incidents and 25,049 assault incidents. Justice Secretary Liz Truss said prisons faced long-standing issues that will not be resolved in weeks. What is going wrong with our prisons? Video: Cannabis smoking in front of prison guards See our special report on prisons under pressure She said the government was investing an extra £100m into the prisons estate, as well as hiring 2,500 more officers. Last year, thousands of staff walked out in protest over health and safety concerns, amid claims the prison system was in meltdown because of overcrowding and staff shortages. A number of serious disturbances also erupted in jails. media captionJustice Secretary Liz Truss says dealing with prison suicides is a huge priority The MOJ figures show that in the 12 months to September 2016 there were: Seven suicides at Woodhill, in Milton Keynes - the jail with the highest number Five in Bristol and four each in Bedford, Exeter, Humber, Leeds and Manchester prisons A record 354 deaths in custody overall - up by about a third on 2015 Three apparent homicides - down from a record eight in 2015 Nearly 70 assaults every day - the number of serious attacks was up 28% 6,430 assaults on staff - up 40% on 2015. Of these, 761 were classed as serious Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said reducing the jail population was the only realistic way to make our prisons safe in the foreseeable future. Prisons in England in Wales are at 98% capacity, with 85,058 inmates, according to latest figures. The vast majority of inmates - 81,102 - are men. Mr Dawson added: We know that the worst outcomes happen in overcrowded prisons. media captionMichael Irwin was overwhelmed by a feeling of hopelessness in prison Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said suicide rates in prisons were a national scandal. The suicide rate in prisons is 10 times that in the community. So prisons are actually killing people. That shouldn't happen in our prisons. People should at least be safe, she said. Deborah Coles, director of the charity Inquest which works with inmates' families, said the prison estate was a broken system unable to deal with prisoners' problems, such as mental and physical ill health and addictions. Inquest after inquest highlights the same systemic failures, Ms Coles added. 'Desperate need' Professor Pamela Taylor, chairwoman of the Royal College of Psychiatrists' forensic faculty, said that the prison estates' mental health teams were understaffed and struggling to help prisoners in desperate need. She said: In many cases there is no-one available to escort prisoners to in-prison clinics; from time to time, even when a psychiatrist goes to a prisoner's cell... there are not enough prison officers present and the cell door can't be unlocked for safety reasons. Her comments came after the Prisons Ombudsman found the criminal justice system did too little to protect a vulnerable inmate who electrocuted himself in prison. Dean Saunders, 25, died at HMP Chelmsford in Essex in January 2016. The MoJ said the rise in assaults had coincided with major changes to the prison regime, operating arrangements and culture in prisons over the last five years. It pointed to restructuring of the prison estate including staff reductions, which have reduced overall running costs, and an increasing awareness of gang culture and illicit psychoactive drugs in prisons. The ministry added: As well as the dangers to both physical and mental health, trading in these illicit drugs can lead to debt, violence and intimidation. £1.3bn plans Ms Truss said she had taken immediate action to stabilise the prison estate by tackling issues such as drugs and the use of phones that undermined security. She added: These are long-standing issues that will not be resolved in weeks or months but our wholesale reforms will lay the groundwork to transform our prisons, reduce reoffending and make our communities safer. In November, Ms Truss unveiled a White Paper detailing a £1.3bn investment in new prisons over five years, with plans for extra officers, drug tests and more autonomy for governors. The move followed calls from prison governors for an independent public inquiry into the increase in violence and suicides in jails.",TRUE
"Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, is strongly considering a bid for U.S. Senate, calculating that having Hillary Clinton at the top of the 2016 ticket would help lift her candidacy in a year-of-the-woman campaign.  Driving Wasserman Schultz’s interest: the increasing likelihood that Sen. Marco Rubio will run for the White House and that he ultimately won’t seek reelection in 2016, Democratic insiders familiar with her thinking say. Her office wouldn’t discuss her interest in the Senate.  “Of course she’s considering it: Open Senate seats are pretty rare,” said Andrew Weinstein, a longtime supporter of the Weston congresswoman and a 2012 member of President Barack Obama’s national finance team.  “If you’re a nationally known candidate with a strong fundraising record and a good relationship with your constituents and supporters, you would definitely look at it,” Weinstein added.  Like a number of Democratic insiders — four of whom spoke on condition of anonymity in confirming her Senate interest — Weinstein stressed he wasn’t favoring any potential candidate and didn’t want to appear to slight Rep. Patrick Murphy, who represents Florida’s 18th Congressional District and is considered the most likely Democrat to seek a Senate seat in 2016.  “He is very seriously considering the Senate race — whether Rubio runs or not,” said Eric Johnson, Murphy’s chief of staff and top political adviser.  Also expressing some interest behind the scenes: former Gov. Charlie Crist, who has lost his past two elections — governor in 2012 and Senate in 2010, the latter against Rubio. Crist, who couldn’t be reached, would be far less likely to run for the Senate again if he had to run against an incumbent Rubio.  The same is likely true of Wasserman Schultz, who’s in a safe seat.  Murphy sits in a far more competitive district, though he defeated his Republican opponent handily in 2014.  “It’s not a question of if he loses his seat, but when,” one Democratic consultant said of Murphy. “Make no mistake: He has won two hard races. He knows how to win. He can raise big money. That matters. So it makes sense he’ll run for Senate. And the [Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee] loves the guy.”  Wasserman Schultz has a fraught relationship with some Washington Democrats.  For years, anonymous Democrats in Congress, the DNC and Obama’s election machine have trashed the sometimes-acerbic congresswoman in publications like POLITICO and BuzzFeed.  “Nancy Pelosi views Debbie as a threat,” said one Democratic politician familiar with the dynamics in the U.S. House. “So perhaps they’ll all pitch in together to get her out of the DNC and out of the House and into the Senate where no one can really do anything.”  As DNC chair, Wasserman Schultz has major fundraising responsibilities nationwide. Democrats say she can’t realistically be a statewide Florida candidate — especially in a potentially contested primary — and fully serve the party at the same time. One Democrat said she could make the decision to leave the DNC no later than April.  Unlike many in Obama’s orbit, Wasserman Schultz has the aura of a Clinton-machine Democrat. She was Hillary Clinton’s co-chair for her 2008 race. Some Democrats have accused her of being disloyal to Clinton toward the end of the contest against Obama, but others say the relationship between the two women is strong.  Wasserman Schultz wouldn’t comment on the chatter. “My only focus right now is serving the people of Florida’s 23rd District in Congress and electing the 45th President of the United States,” she said in a statement.  Florida has had only one female U.S. senator, Republican Paula Hawkins, who served from 1981-87.  Some Democrats are salivating at the prospect of a history-making, two-woman top-of-the-ticket race in Florida. They also hope a female Senate candidate would attract unmarried female voters, who tend to vote Democrat but disproportionately avoid voting in Florida midterms along with African-Americans and Hispanics.  Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans by 3.6 percentage points in Florida, yet the GOP controls the four statewide elected offices based in Tallahassee, one U.S. Senate seat, a supermajority in the state House and a majority in the state Senate — and that’s despite an anti-gerrymandering constitutional amendment voters approved in 2010.  Presidential election years are much kinder to Florida Democrats: Obama won the state twice, and Sen. Bill Nelson was easily reelected in 2012.  Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz | M. Scott Mahaskey  Wasserman Schultz’s supporters first whispered about her as a possible Senate pick during the 2012 cycle. Many wanted Nelson to run for governor and, if he won, to pick Wasserman Schultz as his replacement an appointment, however, that could have been disputed under Florida law.  The buzz died down as Crist’s candidacy surged, but it’s back now that Democrats believe Rubio is more serious about not seeking reelection if he pursues a White House run. Under state law, Rubio would have to choose which office to pursue.  Follow @politico  Rubio hasn’t completely pledged to not seek reelection if he runs for president. But he has almost shut the door on the possibility.  “If I’m running for president, I’m running for president,” Rubio told POLITICO. “That wouldn’t be my strategy or my thought or my plan. My plan would be to run for president to win.”  Rubio said he has no favored potential successor: “I think we have a deep bench of quality candidates. I’m sure a good one will be our nominee and will win it. I haven’t made that decision. But I anticipate when you are running for president, you have your hands full.”  A number of Republicans want more assurances before they start up plans to run. Among the possible GOP candidates: state CFO Jeff Atwater, former House Speaker Will Weatherford, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera and U.S. Reps. Ron DeSantis and Vern Buchanan.  As for the Democrats, aside from Wasserman Schultz, Murphy and Crist, Miami Beach Mayor Phil Levine, independently wealthy and a friend of the Clintons, hasn’t tamped down speculation about his potential interest. Nor has U.S. Rep. Ted Deutch of Boca Raton.  Most top Florida Democrats say that Wasserman Schultz would be tough to beat because of her high name recognition and fundraising prowess. Top-tier Florida campaigns cost at least $10 million. Gov. Rick Scott spent the most, about $115 million in 2014, to defeat Crist by just 1.08 percentage points.  Wasserman Schultz’s post at the DNC has both pluses and minuses for a potential Senate candidacy. While she has greatly expanded her fundraising contact list and media profile, she also could be perceived as too much of a liberal partisan in conservative and moderate quarters of Florida.  “I hear from many people she is interested. I think her problem will be the notion of statewide,” Orlando trial lawyer John Morgan, an Obama donor, said by email. “She is very safe and popular inside her district but coming out from there will be a problem in my opinion. As chair of the DNC you are the attack dog for the party. It’s your job. You become polarizing.”  Morgan employs Crist in his law firm and said the Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat’s pollster, John Anzalone, has indicated that Crist might seek the Senate seat. Anzalone also polled for a medical-marijuana initiative Morgan underwrote in 2014, when it fell about 3 percentage points shy of the needed 60 percent voter-approval threshold for a state constitutional amendment.  Morgan and Wasserman Schultz had a public falling out over medical marijuana when he blasted her as an “irrelevant … irritant” once she echoed conservative criticisms of the initiative.  Medical marijuana isn’t the only surprisingly conservative position for the otherwise liberal congresswoman. For years, Wasserman Schultz has voted with most Republicans and against most Democrats in favor of keeping a hard line against Cuba’s Castro dictatorship. After Obama announced his plan to normalize relations, Wasserman Schultz’s statement was markedly delayed and tepid.  U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson spoke highly of Wasserman Schultz — even though he is eyeing a 2016 Senate bid as well.  “I would not run against Debbie Wasserman Schultz out of respect and admiration for her,” Grayson said in an interview. “She would be almost impossible to beat in a Democratic primary anyway.”  Grayson said he believed former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, should he go ahead with a presidential bid in 2016, would have “coattails” for a Republican candidate in Florida, making it all the better to have a ticket led by Wasserman Schultz and Hillary Clinton, who bests Bush by inside-the-error-margin amounts in early Florida polls.  Asked if Wasserman Schultz were seriously considering a run, Grayson said “yes.” When asked whether the two had spoken about the matter, Grayson said he wouldn’t disclose private conversations.  The prospect of a Wasserman Schultz-Murphy primary for Senate could pit the two camps of the Florida Democratic Party against each other: Those who argue for a more centrist approach side with Murphy, and those who favor a candidacy that doesn’t shy away from liberalism are more in Wasserman Schultz’s camp.  The potentially open Senate seat puts Florida Democrats like Steve Schale in a tough spot. Schale, a fan of both Murphy and Wasserman Schultz, served as an adviser to Crist and newly elected U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham, who intends to run for reelection to her 2nd District seat.  Schale said some have dismissed the idea of Wasserman Schultz running, but they might be surprised.  “She’s considering [the] Senate far more seriously than many people are giving her credit for,” Schale said.

"Letter to the Editor of The Washington Post by Mr. Dmitry Polyanskiy, First Deputy Permanent Representative of the Russian Federation to the UN, with regard to the article entitled “A dispatch from the fight against Russian disinformation – and a place where truth is winning” Dear Mr. Baron, I have to address you with regard to the article entitled “A dispatch from the fight against Russian disinformation – and a place where truth is winning” by Mr. Philip Bump, published in “The Washington Post” on 25 July 2018, which mentions me personally in the context of a very sensible topic for us – investigation of 2014 Malaysia Airlines MH17 crash in Ukraine. I would like to stress that I am writing this letter in my personal capacity and I am not directly involved in relevant investigative efforts on our side. But even the information that is available in open sources which could be traced by any researcher allows me to make the conclusions that I make. I would not conceal that I was very much disappointed by this publication which clearly does not meet the standards of an unbiased journalist report. Its main message is to illustrate alleged “Russian efforts to undercut findings” of “independent investigators” and “propaganda efforts of Russian government” in general. Needless to say that the article proceeds from the assumption that Russia was behind the downing of MH17 and all our efforts are aimed just at covering up the culprits. I completely disagree with such a narrative and want to clarify several key points in this regard. Since the very beginning Russia was and continues to be genuinely interested in discovering the truth about this tragic event. We supported all the efforts to conduct full and transparent investigation, we exercised our influence on Donbass rebels who, despite very difficult combat situation caused by the Ukrainian authorities’ obsession to punish their own citizens by military force for their desire to preserve their language and culture, provided unhindered and full access to the crash site. All those who wanted to visit it had the opportunity to do so. Every material evidence was also gathered and transported to the Netherlands for the needs of investigation. We from our side provided a lot of information and material to the investigation team, in particular primary radar data. Upon its request Russia disclosed classified information on Buk missiles 9M38 and 9M38M1. Our producer of this ammunition “Almaz-Antey” also modeled the incident and widely shared technical data and the conclusions of this simulation. The Dutch side is also aware of a lot of witness accounts of people living in this area. We expressed and continue to express our readiness to join the group of investigators. Nevertheless, the Dutch investigators since the very beginning showed particular distrust to our findings and contribution. Russian experts were excluded from their work. Much of the data that we provided was ignored and disregarded in the reports. The trend was very clear – to ignore everything that exposed Ukrainian responsibility for the downing of MH17 and to encourage every claim, be it undocumented or even absurd, that Russia or “Russian-backed rebels” were behind it. It is enough to indicate that the investigators do not press the US to provide satellite data from the day and the site of the crush Americans publicly confirmed that they possess such data, but it is “classified” and accept the refusal of Ukraine to provide primary radar data under laughable pretext. Refusal of Ukrainian authorities to close the airspace over the Eastern part of the country at the day of the crash despite ongoing military operation of Ukrainian forces there which is hard to explain by any logic is also disregarded. In the absence of any trustworthy proofs that “Russians did it” the Dutch investigators started to rely more and more on social media and on the findings of investigator groups like Bellingcat which is in the center of the article. To us the whole idea to use social media accounts as a proof in any investigation is extremely bizarre and doubtful. In our days it is not a problem any more to fake any video or photo with easily available software. We also have a lot of reasons not to trust particularly Bellingcat which was repeatedly caught red-handed by Internet users by voicing anti-Russian or anti-Syrian allegations based on fakes. And these fakes are largely exposed in the Web. Internet users have a lot of questions about Bellingcat financing, important American and Western funds that traditionally support anti-Russian campaigns are said to be the main sponsors of these “investigators”, which casts obvious doubt on their impartiality. Besides, there are a lot of other Internet social-media investigators on the Web who claim things opposite to the “findings” of Bellingcat that clearly indicate that Ukraine is behind the downing of MH17. Why are they ignored while Bellingcat accounts are praised and unquestioned? I personally tried to engage with Bellingcat through my Twitter account @dpol_un. But the moment I doubted their impartiality and illustrated upon their request that they produce fakes I faced a vicious verbal attack from them, including their founder Elliot Higgins who, as was claimed in the article “earned international attention for his exhaustive – and accurate – analysis...”. First of all, they said that I do not exist and called me “Kremlin bot” – a usual tactics for those who disrespect the opinion of the others on the Web. I have to say that this “journalist hero” of yours disappointed me most of all sending personal insults through Twitter. I enclose some of the snapshots for your reference. After the bellingcats, their trolls and bots continued to insult me, I had to blacklist some of them, including Higgins. Of course, no apologies followed up to today which is very illustrative of quality of their “work”. How can “responsible investigators” behave like this? There are hundreds of Internet users who already exposed their lies and all the bellingcats do is attack and bully these users. They just do not have other arguments besides insults and pathetic lies. I believe that the fact that you praise their efforts and close the eyes on all the numerous substantiated claims that they produce fakes is not becoming to the reputation of your distinguished paper. Nor it gives any credit to the Dutch investigators. But let’s put aside the bellingcats, let their conscience judge them, they obviously do not deserve so much attention. What worries me most of all is that after four years of the MH17 tragic accident we are still very far from establishing the truth. Unfortunately, the recent push of the Joint Investigation Team to hold Russia responsible on the basis of bellingcats’ findings, inconclusive and missing data from Ukraine and US and with total disregard of our data and documents is another step in this totally wrong direction. And the attempts to exploit the feelings of the relatives of the victims, mobilize them in support of these unsubstantiated claims are absolutely immoral. My country remains ready to join international investigative efforts to find the truth about MH17 crash. We are also consistently supporting the efforts to find those responsible of this crime and bring them to justice. Russia must be part of the investigation team and not its object – nobody has cancelled the presumption of innocence principle. What we do not accept are ultimatums and fakes. Given the fact that my name was quoted in the abovementioned article in a very dubious context I respectfully ask you to publish my letter in your newspaper. I will also make it open and publish it on the website of our Permanent Mission. Sincerely yours, Dmitry Polyanskiy First Deputy Permanent Representative",FALSE

The father of Kamala Harris detailed how their ancestors owned slaves.  TRENDING: You Son of a Bitch! YOU PUNK! - Geraldo LOSES IT ON LIVE TV after Dan Bongino Lays Him Out on Hannity! VIDEO  The Democrats have been up in arms about an NBC News report that detailed how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s great-great-grandfathers owned slaves in Alabama in the 1800s.  Donald Harris, a Stanford University economics professor and father of 2020 Democrat candidate, wrote about how they are descendant of an Irishman who owned a slave plantation in Jamaica in a piece titled “Reflections of a Jamaican Father.”  “My roots go back, within my lifetime, to my paternal grandmother Miss Chrishy née Christiana Brown, descendant of Hamilton Brown who is on record as plantation and slave owner and founder of Brown’s Town,” Mr. Harris wrote in his article for Jamaica Global.  The Free Beacon reports that “a research archive of Jamaican records indicate that at one point in 1817, Hamilton Brown owned scores of slaves. The majority were brought in from Africa, though he also owned many Creole slaves.”  Harris has been pushing for “some form of reparations for black people,” saying that “we have to be honest that people in this country do not start from the same place or have access to the same opportunities.” Something her own family history reflects.  McConnell has responded to the reports about his ancestors by pointing out that the family of former President Barack Obama also owned slaves.  “You know, I find myself once again in the same position as President Obama,” McConnell said. “We both oppose reparations, and we both are the descendants of slaveholders.”",TRUE
"ADVERTISEMENT The fire that gutted a flank of the Treasury House, office of the Accountant-General of the Federation, was caused by an electric spark at about 10 a.m. on Wednesday, the Minister of State for Budget and National Planning, Clem Agba, says. Mr Agba spoke with journalists after the fire was put out. He said the fire started in an office on the third floor of the building. He further explained that the fire occurred “after an officer came to the office. He said he put on the air conditioner and there was a spark and immediately he put it off.” Earlier, the Federal Fire Service announced in a tweet that its team had put out the fire, with combined efforts from sister-agencies. This was buttressed by Mr Agba who said the fire service initially had difficulty getting into the building, but after about 35 minutes the fire was contained. “They got inside and fought the fire. Five fire trucks were used within 35 minutes,” he said. Already, there are subtle innuendos on social media that the fire was staged to excuse the government of accounting for funds meant to fight COVID-19 in the country. But Mr Agba brushed this aside, saying that not only is its data intact, its operations are largely digital. “We have gone round the offices that were affected, our data centre where all our records are fully intact. There is no disruption. For a while now we have gone digital,” the minister added, a mask strapped around his mouth, himself and his audience violating the physical distancing directive. “Even if the data centre were to be affected, we have a backup centre that is outside Abuja, in the event we experience loss of any data. “The only thing that happened to the data centre is the cooling unit which is in the exterior at the back. The cooling unit will be put in order,” he noted, saying that the unit has been closed temporarily. Meanwhile the FCT police commissioner, Bala Ciroma, who also briefed journalists at the scene of the incident, said an investigation into the cause of the fire had commenced. The minister alluded to this, too. He said while “a few documents were burnt,” the extent of the damages is yet to be ascertained.”",TRUE

A monthly analysis of forecasts prepared for Chancellor Philip Hammond showed that dozens of independent experts believe national output will continue growing this year. On average, they expect growth to continue at exactly the same rate as forecast before the EU referendum. Contrary to what economists and big banks like Goldman Sachs said, Brexit has heralded a new wave of growth as Britain prepares to unshackle itself from Brussels Craig Mackinlay The verdict was a major reversal following earlier expectations that the country’s decision to leave the EU would deliver a massive shock to the economy. Instead, the data suggests that the historic vote had no significant impact on growth at all. The u-turn was being seen last night as yet another devastating blow to the “Project Fear” scaremongering campaign run by the defeated and embittered supporters of Britain’s EU membership. GETTY Forecasts for Chancellor Philip Hammond showed that national output will continue growing this year GETTY Craig Mackinlay said in just three months 'Project Fear had descended to Project Farce' And it came amid growing expectations in the City that the Government is preparing for a “hard Brexit” that will mean quitting the EU single market and imposing full border controls. Tory MP Craig Mackinlay, who backed the Leave campaign, said: “In just three months Project Fear has descended into Project Farce. “Contrary to what economists and big banks like Goldman Sachs said, Brexit has heralded a new wave of growth as Britain prepares to unshackle itself from Brussels. “With new global free trade deals on the horizon the British economy has never looked so buoyant.” Brexit aftershocks: Who's next to leave the EU?

Play slideshow Express 1 of 10 Frexit, Nexit or Auxit? Who will be next to leave the EU GETTY Contrary to what big banks such as Goldman Sachs claimed, Britain has seen a new wave of growth And Richard Tice, chairman of the Brexit-backing pressure group Leave Means Leave, said: “Every week more data shows that Project Fear was a pack of lies. “Prospects are looking good for British business following British voters backing Brexit in June. “Demand in the financial services sector is up and UK manufacturing has become a global contender once again.” Theresa May should trigger the formal process for leaving the EU by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty at the first possible opportunity, he said. “The Government should invoke Article 50 at the soonest opportunity to maintain momentum and strengthen business confidence further.” Each month, the Treasury collects forecasts from more than 30 leading independent financial bodies including City banks, think tanks and universities and publishes an average of their predictions. The first monthly average after the Brexit vote on June 23 downgraded the growth forecast for 2016 from 1.8% to 1.5%. But the latest Treasury comparison has returned to the original 1.8% growth forecast for the year. According to the survey, the experts still expect the economy to slow down next year, but are increasingly revising those forecasts upward. GETTY Mr Tice said Theresa May should trigger Article 50 at the first opportunity In July, the average prediction was for growth in 2017 was 0.5% but the figure has nearly doubled to 0.9% in the latest Treasury comparison. The data emerged yesterday as a leading spokesman for the financial services sector hailed the “opportunities” ahead for the country following Brexit. Miles Celic, the chief executive of financial services lobbying organisation TheCityUK, told a fringe meeting at the Labour Party conference in Liverpool that leaving the EU would open up British trade to the world. He said: “In terms of the opportunities we could look at doing more with other parts of the world. “It is an opportunity for doing more with the US, Australia and Canada. “We can also look at opportunities places like Asia the fastest growing part of the world, Africa with the ten fast growing economies in the world and Latin America as well. “I do wonder sometimes whether or not we have perhaps made as much of those relationships and partnerships as we might have done.” He also warned against people in the financial sector pushing for a rerun of the referendum. He said: “One of the most important things to recognise is that the people have spoken and people may have felt very positive about or they may have felt very negative about it but the direction has now been set and it is now for the government and industry and others to deliver on that.” GETTY Richard Tice said data reveals 'Project Leave was a pack of lies'",other
"During the Republican National convention, President Trump spent a lot of time covering the dangers and ill-advised policies of a Biden administration. An America under the supervision of the radical Democrat candidate seems, at least to his watchful eye, a disaster in the making with our very lives and freedoms in serious jeopardy.  Just recently, Biden confirmed one of those very fears during a campaign speech at the Joe Barron Jewish community center in Pohtaytoe, Virginia, referring to the sacred and God-blessed second amendment right of all Americans to own and use firearms at any time anywhere for any reason whatsoever as “obsolete.” Clearly, this is either a case of Trump being right on the money, or a satirical article to drive gullible trumpers into blood pressure fits.  Supporters of the President constitute the country’s least educated and most violently gullible of citizens, and do, in fact, believe idiotic things about the amendment that are laughably untrue. Such as that it’s purpose is to fight the government should it become tyrannical. Sure, Jethro, they went through all the work of designing a country and government the likes of which the world had never seen, and then put in a self-destruct button in case you didn’t want to wear a mask, you pussy.  The truth is, there have only been two times the second amendment has been threatened in recent memory. The first was when Trump himself suggested “taking the guns and worrying about the legal stuff later.” The second was when Trump lied and said that Biden was coming after it. To no great shock, Trump’s parade of happy dipshits ignored the first and blew their own balls off about the second.  The history of gun-grabbing is long and storied, and always pushed as a fear tactic by republicans. Although the total number of guns confiscated by democrats remains at a steady “0”, it doesn’t stop the gullible from believing.",FALSE
"Dave Janda of Operation Freedom www.DaveJanda.com has unleashed a bombshell story with huge implications for Tuesday’s elections. Janda’s guest in his latest broadcast is a former high-level intelligence official Lt. Gen. Tom McInerney who warns that the Dems and the CIA have put in place a mechanism which can alter the voting results of electronic voting machines in key swing states like Pennsylvania that will determine the outcome of the election.  This covert technology is called Operation Scorecard, and it was built by the CIA to surreptitiously steal elections in targeted countries. Now, that technology is being turned against the United States of America and is about to be activated on Tuesday to steal the election for Biden, explains Janda’s guest.  OmegaManRadio, a pro-liberty, pro-Christian podcast channel, has reposted portions of the Dave Janda interview at this link on Soundcloud.com. Start listening around the 20 minute mark to hear the bombshell segments.  The original interview from Dave Janda is currently available via YouTube but is likely to be blacklisted soon. Here’s the YouTube embed:  As McInerney explains in the video, after the closing of polls in Pennsylvania and other swing states, the voting machines will be intercepted and then altered using complex algorithms to alter the votes in a way that evades detection, handing a victory to the pre-designated “winner” Joe Biden.  Smells like FREEDOM. Order Founders Blend Organic Coffee from Freedom First Coffee. Use NOQ as the promo code for 10% off!  In the interview, he explains that a covert app called “Scorecard” steals votes by making sure Democrats always stay about 3% ahead of their Republican rivals. “Scorecard steals the elections by tampering with the computers at the transfer points,” he adds.  This also explains why Joe Biden recently said, with great clarity, “We have put together I think the most extensive and inclusive voter fraud organization in the history of American politics.”  Here’s the video of Biden bragging about the massive voter fraud system that’s being used to try to to steal the election for him:  This might also help explain why Joe Biden told voters at a recent small rally that he didn’t “need their vote” to become President, and why Nancy Pelosi says Biden will win no matter what the votes say on Nov. 3rd.  The deep state has a plan in place to steal this election by altering votes in key swing states. And if Trump challenges the fraud, he will be condemned for “refusing to accept the outcome” of the rigged election. This is the narrative trap that has been set by the treasonous mainstream media.  Keep in mind that just over the last two days, Trump campaign officials were asking for detailed information about how voting machines are handled in Pennsylvania. According to the anti-Trump Washington Post a deep state propaganda mouthpiece:  …the Trump campaign asked officials in Cumberland County for the names of people who transport ballots and voting machines once polls close, the names of people who have access to the ballots afterward, and the precise locations where the ballots are stored, including room numbers.  It seems that Trump’s people are already aware that Dems are working to fraudulently steal this election by altering votes in Pennsylvania, and they’re trying to stop it.  Be aware that unless Trump receives an overwhelming wave of votes on Tuesday — beyond the margin of Democrat fraud — the Dems have a mechanism in place to steal the election, condemn Trump for challenging the vote theft, and seizing control of the White House from this day forward.  Spread this story far and wide. Everything is now at stake.

We have ads on the site that help, but since the site’s inception this has been a labor of love that otherwise doesn’t bring in the level of revenue necessary to justify it.  When I left a nice, corporate career in 2017, I did so knowing I wouldn’t make nearly as much money. But what we do at NOQ Report to deliver the truth and fight the progressive mainstream media narrative that has plagued this nation is too important for me to sacrifice it for the sake of wealth. We know we’ll never make a ton of money this way, and we’re okay with that.  Things have become harder with the coronavirus lockdowns. Both ad money and donations that have kept us afloat for a while have dropped dramatically. We thought we could weather the storm, but the so-called “surge” or “2nd-wave” that mainstream media and Democrats are pushing has put our prospects in jeopardy.

"One in four women develop mental health problems while pregnant, a study has found. Awareness is growing about post-natal depression – but few people know problems can arrive before the baby is born. Researchers at King’s College London diagnosed mental health problems among 27 per cent of pregnant women. Using a gold-standard psychological screening technique at midwife appointments, they found 11 per cent of women had depression, 15 per cent had anxiety, 2 per cent had eating disorders and 2 per cent obsessive-compulsive disorders, with many women having combinations of different problems. These are usually missed because people wrongly believe women always suffer a feel-good ‘glow’ when they become pregnant. One in four women develop mental health problems while pregnant, a study has found. Awareness is growing about post-natal depression – but few people know problems can arrive before the baby is born ‘This is a myth,’ said researcher Professor Louise Howard, of the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience at King’s. ‘People think that pregnancy is protective of mental health, and then the post-natal period is a trigger for problems. But in reality problems start during pregnancy or even earlier – it is very common.’ She said rare and serious forms of mental disorders – such as severe post-natal psychosis – may be triggered by childbirth. But less severe depression and anxiety are likely to start during pregnancy itself. Clinical psychologist Dr Camilla Rosan of the Mental Health Foundation, an expert in maternity, said pregnancy was a huge transformation in a woman’s life. ‘It’s a time of lots of changes,’ she said. ‘There is a major renegotiation of a woman’s identity, anxiety about what kind of mother she might be, and it sometimes reactivates problems from her own childhood. These are all potential triggers – and old traumas and pre-existing problems can also return.’ Crucially, she said, women are at a vulnerable point in their lives. And the impacts of depression or anxiety can have lasting effects on women and babies. ‘When you experience stress when you are pregnant it leads to changes in levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Studies show these can have an impact on the development of the growing baby' She said: ‘When you experience stress when you are pregnant it leads to changes in levels of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. Studies show these can have an impact on the development of the growing baby – it can affect their later academic achievements and cause problems with the development of emotional relationships.’ The study, funded by the research arm of the NHS and published in the British Journal of Psychiatry, involved 545 pregnant women in South London. Professor Howard said women are seen so often by medical professionals during pregnancy they should never slip through the net. Her study showed using proper psychological screening tools, based on simple questions about mood, could pick up problems. ‘In clinical practice, maternity professionals need to identify whether or not a woman has any mental disorder, not only mood disorders which until recently have been the main focus of concern. ‘Women should be asked, by a non-judgemental and supportive health professional, at all contacts in pregnancy and after birth about their emotional wellbeing.’",partially false

"Addressing a meeting of the committee on Monday, Mohammad Zareian added that the report has been drafted solely based upon unverified, biased and tendentious sources and is merely politically- motivated. Full text of his remarks is as follows: In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful Madam. Chair, The report on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran A/75/213 has been drafted solely based upon unverified, biased and tendentious sources and is nothing short of politically motivated. It has not been prepared out of the genuine concern of its orchestrators, but rather with the interest of justifying their policy of aggression and hostility while contributing to their declared objective of subverting the constitutional order legitimately established by the Iranian people. This, in turn, constitutes a flagrant violation of the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, the International Law and International Human Rights Law. Those behind the preparation of the report have manipulated the issues of human rights against my Government in order to distort our realities with false information. It is no secret that provoking the so-called human rights issues are part of the US “maximum pressure strategy” against Iranians. Terrorists, including those who used to be on the terror list of Western countries until recently, have become sweetheart allies in this evil campaign against Iranians. The tragedy, however, lies in the complacency of the UN mechanisms which have become part of such scheming. Glorification of criminals whose hands are stained with the blood of civilians and law enforcement officers, as victims of ethnic or religious discrimination, is abhorrent. Although the specific cases have been raised in the report, were responded to separately in detail by the authorities, the author’s prejudices have marred the report in its entirety, as different parts of the report have been imbued with personal biases. Propagation of fake news and repeated opinionated interpretations, are among several fundamental flaws in the report. Madam Chair, One may wonder if those who are behind the report were racing against time to line up a number of unsubstantiated allegations against my Government. Had they been sincerely concerned about the human rights of Iranians, they would have immediately prepared a mandate to hold the Government of the United States accountable for its inhumane and illegal unilateral coercive measures, which have systematically been intensified in recent months, even amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. The unilateral and illegal sanctions imposed by the United States against Iran constitute the crime against humanity, violating the human rights of an entire nation. The US sanctions have not only had a destructive impact on the well-being of my people, but also continue to prevent them from fully enjoying their human rights. The US sanction policy has always been an inhumane punishment policy targeting and affecting an entire population particularly children and adults with cancer and rare diseases, however, the novel coronavirus has highlighted the cruelty and malice of this crime. The broad limitations imposed on Iran as a result of cruel and illegal US sanctions, prevent my country from purchasing medicines, medical equipment and other necessary supplies to face the pandemic. Madam Chair, Regretfully, the human rights mechanisms have been unable or unwilling to hold Washington accountable for its cowardly and vicious assassination of Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani, who was the all-conquering hero for bringing Takfiri terrorism to its knees in Iraq and Syria in order to restore peace and security to the region and defend human rights. The silence of the so-called flag-bearers of human rights advocates, with regards to this barbaric crime committed by the U.S. with the cooperation and collaboration of certain countries, including Germany, is deafening now more than ever. Madam. Chair, The UN Human Rights Bodies and officials, on multiple occasions, have complained that they are facing a funding crisis. One may wonder how it is possible then to have released four reports annually on the situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran. I would like to assure you that such reports have not only been drawn up based on a selective approach, but are also almost identical and in violation of the principles of universality, impartiality and objectivity. My delegation rejects, in the strongest terms, the allegations contained in the report; the ill-wisher’s prejudices and hasty judgments have rendered it unfounded and far from reality.

"Joseph R. Biden declared last year on the campaign trail that he began his academic career at Delaware State University, a historically Black college, a claim that the school refutes.  Carlos Holmes, director of news service for Delaware State, said that Mr. Biden was never a student, although he has made appearances twice on campus for commencement speeches at the public university in Dover, one of the nation’s historically Black colleges and universities HBCUs.  “Vice President Biden did not attend DSU,” said Mr. Holmes in a Thursday email. “However he was the Commencement keynote speaker in 2003 and [2016], and during the former he was awarded an honorary doctoral degree.”  Mr. Biden made the claim ahead of the South Carolina Democratic primary during a town hall held Oct. 26, 2019, at historic Wilson High School in Florence, which was founded in 1866 by the Freedmen’s Bureau for Black children seeking an education.  “I got started out of an HBCU, Delaware State — now, I don’t want to hear anything negative about Delaware State,” Mr. Biden told the audience, drawing laughter, as shown on video. “They’re my folks.”  Mr. Biden, who went on to win the South Carolina primary on his way to the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination, has been long accused of making up the DSU connection, but the university’s denial appears to erase any doubt.  The Washington Times has reached out to the Biden campaign for comment.  Mr. Biden’s 2007 memoir, “Promises to Keep,” proceeds from his years at Archmere Academy, a private Catholic school in Clayton, Delaware, to his enrollment as a freshman at the University of Delaware without mentioning Delaware State.  Biden claims he “got started out of an HBCU, Delaware State” when he did not attend the universitypic.twitter.com/LnBOS1wQlT — Tommy Pigott @TCPigott October 26, 2019  The former vice president has been caught numerous times embellishing his biography, including statements that he was the first in his family to attend college and that his relatives worked as coal miners, both of which he later admitted were false.  Mr. Biden has also been accused of exaggerating his record on civil-rights activism, such as his assertions about participating in marches. During his first presidential run in 1987, for example, he declared that he “marched with tens of thousands,” a claim that has been largely discounted.  The 2010 biography “Joe Biden” by veteran political reporter Jules Witcover described him as someone who was sympathetic to the movement but “was taking no visible part in either the local racial unrest or the war protest.”  “It was not until his exposure to black contemporaries as a lifeguard, he said, that he finally began to understand, and then he saw his best engagement as a lawyer, not a marcher,” the book said.  Earlier this month, the Biden campaign named DSU President Tony Allen, who previously worked as a speechwriter in Mr. Biden’s Senate office, to the Biden transition team advisory council.

"(CNN) The stakes were high when Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren met at Warren's apartment in Washington, DC, one evening in December 2018 . The longtime friends knew that they could soon be running against each other for president. The two agreed that if they ultimately faced each other as presidential candidates, they should remain civil and avoid attacking one another, so as not to hurt the progressive movement. They also discussed how to best take on President Donald Trump, and Warren laid out two main reasons she believed she would be a strong candidate: She could make a robust argument about the economy and earn broad support from female voters. Sanders responded that he did not believe a woman could win. The description of that meeting is based on the accounts of four people: two people Warren spoke with directly soon after the encounter, and two people familiar with the meeting. After publication of this story, Warren herself backed up this account of the meeting, saying in part in a statement Monday, ""I thought a woman could win; he disagreed."" That evening in 2018, Sanders expressed frustration at what he saw as a growing focus among Democrats on identity politics, according to one of the people familiar with the conversation. Warren told Sanders she disagreed with his assessment that a woman could not win, three of the four sources said. Sanders denied the characterization of the meeting in a statement to CNN. ""It is ludicrous to believe that at the same meeting where Elizabeth Warren told me she was going to run for president, I would tell her that a woman couldn't win,"" Sanders said. ""It's sad that, three weeks before the Iowa caucus and a year after that private conversation, staff who weren't in the room are lying about what happened. What I did say that night was that Donald Trump is a sexist, a racist and a liar who would weaponize whatever he could. Do I believe a woman can win in 2020? Of course! After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016."" Warren's communications director Kristen Orthman declined to comment. These previously unreported details from the two senators' private meeting shed new light on the careful efforts that Warren and Sanders appear to have made to manage their friendship and political rivalry even before the 2020 race was officially underway. From the start, even as both candidates were determined to capture the Democratic nomination, they were also keenly sensitive to the risk that their rivalry could divide the progressive movement. The conversation also illustrates the skepticism among not only American voters but also senior Democratic officials that the country is ready to elect a woman as president, several years after one clinched a major political party's nomination for president for the first time. Many Democrats believe sexism played a role in Hillary Clinton's defeat in the 2016 general election, and voters say they are torn about whether to try again to put a woman in the White House in 2020. The revelation that Sanders expressed skepticism that Warren could win the presidency because she is a woman is particularly noteworthy now, given that Warren is the lone female candidate at the top of the Democratic field. And notably, their meeting in December 2018 came just weeks after a record number of women had been elected to the House of Representatives, helping to deliver the majority to the Democrats. Democrats have been intensely debating questions of identity and representation in recent years, and the party's historically diverse field of White House candidates this cycle has featured multiple women. Sanders himself weighed in shortly after the 2016 election, saying that ""one of the struggles that you're going to be seeing in the Democratic Party is whether we go beyond identity politics."" ""I think it's a step forward in America if you have an African American CEO of some major corporation. But you know what, if that guy is going to be shipping jobs out of this country, and exploiting his workers, it doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot whether he's black or white or Latino,"" he said at an appearance in Boston to promote his book, according to WBUR ""Name your favorite woman president"" Warren has grown increasingly vocal over the past few months on the role of sexism and gender inequality in politics, including experiences the Massachusetts Democrat said she has endured in the years that she has been in public office. On the campaign trail, Warren tells voters the story of how some male colleagues have advised her to ""smile more"" and being discouraged from running for Senate in 2012 because she was a woman. ""Over and over, we are told that women are not allowed to be angry. It makes us unattractive to powerful men who want us to be quiet,"" Warren wrote in a campaign email in November, with the subject line: ""I am angry and I own it."" Three weeks ahead of the Iowa caucuses, Warren is now the only woman polling in the double-digits nationally. A new CNN/Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll showed Warren in a four-way race in Iowa, along with Sanders, former South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and former Vice President Joe Biden. In that survey, Sanders and Warren performed nearly equally well as the top choice among female likely Democratic caucusgoers, while Sanders and Buttigieg were the top choice among men. Last month, Warren said in Las Vegas that she had ""lived enough of my life with men, and it's mostly been men, telling me to sit down and be quiet."" Days later, she acknowledged that this was a dynamic she had experienced in the current campaign. Warren's rivals have also grappled with the issue of sexism in politics. Biden recently said on the campaign trail that Clinton had confronted ""unfair"" sexist attacks in the last election, and added: ""That's not going to happen with me."" Sen. Amy Klobuchar said recently that female candidates with as little political experience as Buttigieg would not have qualified for the presidential debate. ""Women are held to a higher standard,"" the Minnesota Democrat said. ""Otherwise we could play a game called 'Name Your Favorite Woman President,' which we can't do because it has all been men."" A fraying non-aggression pact The New York Times first reported over a year ago that Warren and Sanders met in Washington in December 2018. That initial report said that neither senator sought each other's support, and that they did not try to dissuade one another from running in the 2020 election. If Warren and Sanders agreed on a non-aggression pact of sorts that night, that agreement has become increasingly frayed. Over the last year, Sanders aides and advisers have taken to social media to criticize Warren on numerous issues, including ""Medicare for All,"" student loan debt cancelation and the ""wealth tax."" Some of his allies have also implicitly and explicitly gone after Warren on the broader question of who has the rightful claim to the progressive mantle in 2020. ""People have to decide do they want originals or do they want copies,"" Nina Turner, Sanders' campaign co-chair, told CNN over the summer. ""He's the original."" Politico reported over the weekend on the Sanders campaign's talking points instructing volunteers to say that Warren's supporters are ""highly-educated, more affluent people who are going to show up and vote Democratic no matter what"" and that ""she's bringing no new bases into the Democratic Party."" Campaigning in Marshalltown, Iowa, Warren told reporters that she was ""disappointed to hear that Bernie is sending his volunteers out to trash me."" ""Bernie knows me, and has known me for a long time,"" Warren said. ""He knows who I am, where I come from, what I have worked on and fought for, and the coalition and grassroots movement we're trying to build."" Sanders himself appeared to distance himself from the memo, saying on Sunday that his campaign has ""hundreds of employees"" and that ""people sometimes say things that they shouldn't."" ""I have never said a negative word about Elizabeth Warren, who is a friend of mine,"" Sanders said. UPDATE: This story has been updated with Warren's statement after publication backing up sources' accounts.",other

Inspector Anthony Canard is the commanding officer of Spotlight. “Everyone knew Vatican City was the center of an international pedophile ring,” he stated. “We sent busloads of orphans into Vatican City for the annual Cardinal Convention. Long story short? The kids were never in harm’s way, and we nabbed a lot of perps.”  At that point, Vatican City was still an independent country. Italian police had to smuggle the cardinals out on the bus to face criminal charges in Italian courts.  Catholic clergy overseas are quick to point out their peers who are under arrest are victims of a virulent strain of anti-Catholicism and hatred of the man-boy sacrament.  Invasion!  Once Spotlight ended and the pedophile ring jailed, the Italian government moved quickly. Local units of the military swept into Vatican City. “We were sick and tired of looking the other way,” an anonymous politician noted.  Swiss Guards were caught unaware. It was obvious their pointy pikes were no match for assault rifles. The invasion was bloodless. No one was injured.  At this time, the Italian government isn’t sure what it’s going to do with all the wealth the papacy built up over the centuries. Insiders say many buildings will be transformed into museums. Other assets will probably be auctioned off and given to survivors of clergy abuse. “It’s poetic justice,” one government official remarked, “and the pedophile priests just got slammed with poetry.”  In related news, a 13-year-old boy gave up masturbating because Jesus wanted him to.

"Last week Rep. Louie Gohmert told Chris Salcedo on Newsmax that people on the ground in Germany report that Scytl, which hosted elections data improperly through Spain, was raided by a large US ARMY force and their servers were seized in Frankfurt. The video went viral. Here is what Rep. Louie Gohmert R-TX had to say about this alleged raid earlier today. TRENDING: You Son of a Bitch! YOU PUNK! - Geraldo LOSES IT ON LIVE TV after Dan Bongino Lays Him Out on Hannity! VIDEO We later posted more information we received from our source on this raid in Germany. From our source: The US government, once they determined that this Dominion server was involved in switching votes, then the intelligence community began a search for the server and discovered that the server was in Germany. In order to get access to that server and have it available for use in a legal manner they had to have the State Department work in tandem with the Department of Justice. They had to request that the government of Germany cooperate in allowing this seizure of this server. The appropriate documents required to affect that kind of seizure were put in place, signed off on, and it appears there was also US military support in this operation. The US military was not in the lead. But this helps explain why Esper was fired and Miller and Kash Patel were put in place — so that the military would not interfere with the operation in any way. By getting ahold of the server they now are going to have the direct evidence of when they were instructed to stop counting. They will also discover who gave the direction to stop counting and who initiated the algorithm that started switching votes. The CIA was completely excluded from this operation.

"The HPV vaccine is far more effective than expected, with benefits extending beyond those who receive the vaccine, a study published Wednesday finds.  The new study, published in The Lancet, suggests that the more people who receive the vaccine, the better. That’s because vaccination not only reduces rates of HPV infection and the presence of precancerous cells in the cervix in people who receive the vaccine, it also reduces rates of HPV-related diseases in people who were not vaccinated.  The findings come as a U.S. federal advisory panel recommended Wednesday that the HPV vaccine be given to both men and women up to age 26.  HPV, or human papillomavirus, is the leading cause of cervical cancer. The virus can also cause other cancers, including cancers of the penis, head and neck, as well as conditions like genital warts.  The HPV vaccine was first introduced in 2006. Since then, more than 115 countries and territories have implemented it in their vaccination programs. The World Health Organization recommends that girls ages 9 to 13 receive two doses of the vaccine.  “The impact of the HPV vaccination has actually exceeded expectations,” said Lauri Markowitz, associate director of science for HPV at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who worked on the study. The trials showed that HPV vaccines are very effective, and data from the real world has confirmed that.”  Indeed, the reductions in HPV infections and precancerous cells “are a first sign that vaccination could eventually lead to the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem,” the study's lead author, Mélanie Drolet, an epidemiologist at Laval University in Canada, said in a statement.  The Lancet study expanded upon a 2015 meta-analysis that had looked at the real-world effects of the vaccine. The new analysis was updated to include a total of 65 studies, which spanned eight years and included more than 60 million people living in 14 countries. Each study measured either changes in the number of new HPV infections, genital warts diagnoses or cases of abnormal cells associated with cervical cancer in countries before and after they adopted routine HPV vaccination in girls. Two countries included in the analysis, the U.S. and Australia, also recommend the vaccine for boys.  The impact of the HPV vaccination has actually exceeded expectations.  The researchers found that, in these countries, there was a significant decrease in the prevalence of two strains of HPV that cause 70 percent of cervical cancers, HPV 16 and 18. There are more than 100 strains of HPV, 14 of which are known to cause cancer. The HPV vaccine protects against up to 9 strains. In addition, there was a decrease in the prevalence of precancerous cells in the cervix, which can develop into cancer.  What’s more, in countries where at least half the population that was targeted for vaccination had actually received the vaccine, researchers saw evidence of herd immunity, meaning there was a decrease in the prevalence of HPV-related diseases even among those who weren’t vaccinated. This is because vaccination leads to fewer HPV hosts.  These countries also saw a decrease in genital warts diagnoses among unvaccinated boys and older women. And among girls within the age groups targeted for vaccination, there were fewer diagnoses of three HPV strains that the vaccine does not specifically protect against, a phenomenon called cross-protection. Countries in which people in multiple age groups received the vaccine also saw a greater decrease in HPV-related disease.  This paper shows that with a broader age range that’s targeted, you’ll find greater impact in your vaccination program,” Markowitz told NBC News.  Lagging vaccination rates  Despite the widespread benefits of the vaccine, however, HPV vaccination rates in the U.S. are still lagging behind those of other adolescent immunizations. The U.S. was the first country to implement HPV vaccination for both genders, but the CDC has found that many parents and health care providers don’t yet see a need to vaccinate boys. Parents have also expressed concerns about the vaccine and its costs, the CDC found.  According to Debbie Saslow, managing director of HPV and gynecological cancers at the American Cancer Society, the lagging rates are not entirely because parents are against vaccinating their kids; rather, the way some doctors are presenting the vaccine also plays a role.  Two required vaccinations, for tetanus and meningitis, are administered at the same time as HPV, around age 12. Saslow said HPV is usually presented as an optional third vaccine at that time, and one that patients can delay another year.  “Providers often think they’re recommending all three vaccines, but they’re actually making the third, the HPV vaccine, optional,” Saslow told NBC News. “They’re just suggesting it or doctors are setting it apart from the other two in some way.”  The fact that HPV is a sexually transmitted infection could also be a hard concept for parents to come to terms with. Saslow said beliefs about sex may be a factor that deters parents from opting to have their children vaccinated against HPV.  “Despite all that, vaccination rates are continuing to grow,” she said.  Indeed, the number of adolescents in the U.S. who received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine has increased by 5 percent each year since 2013. The CDC recommends everyone receive the first dose by age 12. Though adults up to age 45 can still be vaccinated, the vaccine may be less effective. And while the WHO does recommend that girls 9 to 13 get vaccinated against HPV, it does not yet recommend that all genders receive the vaccination. That could change in response to study results that continue to show the vaccine has substantial impact on public health.  Cancer prevention  That impact on public health is cancer prevention. Ultimately, that’s the “main goal of the HPV vaccination program, Markowitz said. We’re seeing an impact on one of the HPV outcomes that is close to a cancer outcome.” Because cervical cancer can take decades to develop, it’s not yet possible to study the effects of the vaccine on cervical cancer rates, Drolet noted in the statement.  In particular, the study found the HPV vaccine led to a reduction in the rates of abnormal pap smear findings. Pap smears are used to detect abnormal cells in the cervix that can sometimes develop into cancer. Five to nine years after a population was vaccinated against HPV, the researchers found a more than 50 percent reduction in cases of these pre-cancerous cells in girls 15 to 19. In vaccinated women 20 to 24, there were one-third fewer cases of these cells.  A separate study, published in April in The BMJ, found a 90 percent reduction in cases of pre-cancerous cells in young women in Scotland within the first decade of introducing the HPV vaccine.  But vaccination is only one piece of cervical cancer prevention; screening is also necessary.  Whether or not a person has received the HPV vaccine, getting cervical cells regularly tested — through Pap tests and HPV screening — is still a crucial to reducing cases of cervical cancer and early detection, said Diane Harper, senior associate director of the Michigan Institute for Clinical and Health Research. Rates of invasive cervical cancer dropped significantly in the U.S. when cancer screening was introduced in the 1940s, and there were less than half the number of cases in 2007 that there were in 1973, largely due to screening.  “Vaccination and screening together make a program,” Harper told NBC News. “Very few HPV cases progress into cancer, but the only way we’re going to find those that do is through the screening program.”  FOLLOW NBC HEALTH ON TWITTER & FACEBOOK",TRUE
"By Jim Francesconi  As we pass the governance torch from the State Board of Higher Education to independent boards at the University of Oregon, Portland State University and Oregon State University, we will be navigating a future of heightened risks and rewards.  The rewards lie in the private sector reinforcements that are coming to the aid of our three major research universities. The caliber of some board nominees are similar to those found at Stanford, Yale, Harvard and other prestigious private universities. Major Oregon CEOs and entrepreneurs have volunteered to use their power, influence and resources to benefit Oregon's public universities.  Oregon is a small state with limited public resources, great needs and high aspirations. Although our universities have a few of the nation's best programs, we are not living up to our potential. That is what happens when state funding for  becomes mired near the bottom of all states for more than 20 years. Now there is the promise to leverage private resources for this vital public purpose.  But there are risks as well. We need high-quality engineering and other research programs, but we cannot afford them at every campus. Portland needs to be served, with PSU in charge, but so does every part of our state. Our small schools should be strengthened, not sacrificed. Sports are important, but not the highest priority. As vital as universities are, they are means to public ends, not ends in and of themselves.  Oregon needs a vibrant, innovative economy. Our universities can create more research collaboratives such as ONAMI Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute and the Portland Life Sciences center, which attract world-class talent and create jobs. Next up ... the Light Metals Institute sponsored by Oregon and Washington universities and the Manufacturing 21 business coalition.  Oregon's per capita income is almost 10 percent below the national average. Universities can prepare more Oregonians for well-paid jobs in health care, STEM fields science, technology, engineering, mathematics, advanced manufacturing and professional-technical careers. And we should take advantage of the growing demographic and political strength of the Latino community by working together to provide access to college and to family-wage jobs.  Above all, Oregon must demonstrate that working people and poor folks can still make it in America. Education after high school is the way, but it is out of reach for many children, especially in rural Oregon. Nearly half of Oregon's children are poor. Half of Oregon university students are on Pell Grants. The average student debt is more than $25,000. As a result, fewer Oregonians are going to college. Like many, my grandparents and parents sacrificed so that I could be the first in my family to go to college. For the first time in Oregon's history, my generation is better educated than the generation that is now college age.  New university board members can raise scholarship funds so that more Oregonians can graduate from UO, PSU and OSU. But these board members should also help increase philanthropy at Southern, Western, Eastern and the Oregon Institute of Technology. All Oregonians from every part of the state should have a chance to achieve their potential and contribute to our state.  Finally, we must understand that philanthropy alone cannot produce excellent universities with innovative research, quality instruction and access for all Oregonians. The Legislature has consistently balanced the budget on the backs of students, forcing tuition increases. New board members have the power to reverse this practice and to force major public investments in our universities for the good of Oregon. Let us work together to apply that power to building an affordable and accessible world-class university system.

The research, which included people in NI, also found that one in four adults who look after children have eaten less so they can feed the children in their household. Sign up to our daily newsletter The i newsletter cut through the noise Sign up Thanks for signing up! Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later. Submitting... Researchers found that half of all adults have tried to cope during the pandemic by purchasing less expensive food which they would not ordinarily choose to buy. Nearly one in three adults who are the least ‘food secure’, and who are looking after children, have also resorted more frequently to eating less so that their children can eat. Kevin Higgins of Advice NI said: “I certainly see these figures as valid for Northern Ireland and this justifies the Covid measures put in place to support people during lockdown.” His organisation, which gives benefits advice, has given extensive support to the vulnerable under lockdown, he said; their NI Covid-19 Community Helpline (0808-802-0020) has answered 18,000 calls since March 27, of which 69% were food related. Mr Higgins also said that some 150,000 food boxes have been distributed across NI under lockdown and that Universal Credit claims in NI have risen from 70,000 to 134,000. “Moving forward I think there needs to be a review of the social security system to ensure it is fit for purpose and provides an adequate income,” he added. Recent improvements to Universal Credit need to be maintained beyond the Covid crisis, he said, and the independent advice sector must be supported to assist people as we emerge from lockdown. Prof Greta Defeyter, director of Northumbria University’s Healthy Living Lab, said: “These findings present an appalling picture of the high percentage of adults experiencing food insecurity in the UK. “If we, as a country, are to stand a chance of getting to grips with this problem, we need the prime minister to oversee and implement with urgency a national food strategy which enhances the supply, affordability, and accessibility of nutritious food to everyone in our country.” This must minimise the need to deploy the many coping strategies, such as the use of food banks, which were identified through the survey, she added. Andrew Forsey, director of Feeding Britain, said: “This survey reveals the lengths to which millions of people in our country are going to keep themselves and their families fed during the pandemic.” The charity is recommending the creation of a jobs programme to prevent long-term unemployment and a review of deductions from Universal Credit and the suspension of the related two-child limit. It is also calling for year-round ‘seamless’ school lunches and breakfasts for children, and tougher employment protections for people in low-paid and precarious work. • FactcheckNI response to this article: Article which claimed that one person in four in Northern Ireland is at risk of hunger was unsubstantiated A message from the Editor: Thank you for reading this story on our website.

"PETITION: Tell the FDA to reverse its opposition to Hydroxychloroquine and help save lives! Sign the petition here.  September 26, 2020 LifeSiteNews – While Democrats and the mainstream media routinely attribute the United States’ relatively high number COVID-19 deaths to Americans’ failure to uniformly wear masks or “socially distance,” a new report suggests the true culprit may be the country’s unwillingness to embrace the drug hydroxychloroquine HCQ.  The United States is estimated to have seen 7.1 million COVID-19 cases as of September 25, with more than 200,000 deaths and 4.4 million recoveries. Officially it has the most cases in the world though that ranking is likely due in part to the authoritarian government of China’s refusal to share accurate numbers.  HCQ has long been approved for use in treating malaria, arthritis, and certain autoimmune conditions, but its potential applications to the coronavirus became a political lightning rod after President Donald Trump first called attention to early studies indicating its potential. The FDA initially issued an Emergency Use Authorization EUA allowing it to be distributed from the Strategic National Stockpile SNS but revoked that authorization in June, claiming “new information” indicated the potential dangers outweighed any potential effectiveness.  However, a white paper published this month by the Economic Standard argues that the primary roadblocks to HCQ are political rather than scientific.  “The U.S. is an international outlier on HCQ,” the paper says. “Right now, doctors around the world are prescribing HCQ to treat COVID-19 outside of hospitals, as well as prophylactically to prevent infection among healthcare workers and vulnerable populations. This paper argues that HCQ has met the appropriate burden of proof and urges members of the U.S. news media, public health community, and regulatory agencies to stop politicizing the use of this medicine. Tens of thousands of lives still hang in the balance.”  The paper lists more than two dozen medical conditions for which HCQ is an established treatment, which it says “reflect a general medical consensus, long predating the COVID-19 pandemic, that HCQ is a safe, well-tolerated drug.”  “In the U.S. alone from 2007-2017, patients received around 59 million prescriptions for HCQ,” the paper explains. “In over seven decades of use, there have been a handful of reports of fatal arrhythmias due to torsades de pointes from all drug causes, and zero reports of fatal arrhythmias with HCQ use. Most cases of arrhythmia involved extraordinary circumstances, including overdoses and patients with end-stage liver failure. Other side effects, such as retinopathy and kidney damage, result only from years of long-term use and have been described as ‘rare.’”  HCQ was identified as a potential COVID-19 treatment relatively early in the outbreak, and has been used in China, South Korea, France, Spain, Italy, Turkey, Malaysia, Bahrain, Poland, Russia, Iran, Egypt, Pakistan, India, and the Philippines, “among many others,” the report says. Yet the United States remains an “international outlier on HCQ, as one of just a handful of countries that have moved to limit – rather than expand – patient access to the drug.”  This, it continues, was due in part to the American news media focusing on “low-quality or botched RTCs [randomized controlled trials] – misrepresenting these as the ‘gold standard’ – while dismissing observational studies as irrelevant due to supposed biases...This narrative was sustained and amplified by scientists, academics, and government agency staff,” with possibly the most egregious example being a notorious study published in The Lancet that the esteemed medical journal was forced to retract after the data sources turned out to be fraudulent.  “A Google News search for the words ‘unproven’ and ‘hydroxychloroquine’ in reports published in April and May returned over 160 results, with most of these articles managing to work the adjective into headlines or opening sentences,” the paper goes on. “None of these reports mentioned that observational trials had discovered useful drugs in the past. Nor did they clarify that many observational studies in aggregate can yield more meaningful results than any one single study, RCTs included.”  Last month, three Republican senators sent a letter to U.S. Food & Drug Administration FDA Commissioner Alex Azar this month demanding an explanation as to why the agency revoked its approval of HCQ against the wishes of American doctors and the experiences of other countries.  LifeSiteNews’ petition calling on the FDA to drop its hostility to hydroxychloroquine has so far collected more than 49,000 signatures.

"When charges of “racism” and “xenophobia” fail, Democrats’ fallback argument against President Trump’s proposed border wall is that it simply “won’t work,” so why waste billions building it? Tell that to the residents of El Paso, Texas. Federal data show a far-less imposing wall than the one Trump envisions — a two-story corrugated metal fence first erected under the Bush administration — already has dramatically curtailed both illegal border crossings and crime in Texas’ sixth-largest city, which borders the high-crime Mexican city of Juarez. In fact, the number of deportable illegal immigrants located by the US Border Patrol plummeted by more than 89 percent over the five-year period during which the controversial new fence was built, according to Homeland Security data I reviewed. When the project first started in 2006, illegal crossings totaled 122,261, but by 2010, when the 131-mile fence was completed from one end of El Paso out into the New Mexico desert, immigrant crossings shrank to just 12,251. They hit a low of 9,678 in 2012, before slowly ticking back up to a total of 25,193 last year. But they’re still well below pre-fence levels, and the Border Patrol credits the fortified barrier dividing El Paso from Mexico for the reduction in illegal flows. And crime abated with the reduced human traffic from Juarez, considered one of the most dangerous places in the world due to drug-cartel violence, helping El Paso become one of the safest large cities in America. Before 2010, federal data show the border city was mired in violent crime and drug smuggling, thanks in large part to illicit activities spilling over from the Mexican side. Once the fence went up, however, things changed almost overnight. El Paso since then has consistently topped rankings for cities of 500,000 residents or more with low crime rates, based on FBI-collected statistics. The turnaround even caught the attention of former Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and other Obama administration officials, who touted it as one of the nation’s safest cities while citing the beefed-up border security there. Federal data illustrates just how remarkable the turnaround in crime has been since the fence was built. According to FBI tables, property crimes in El Paso have plunged more than 37 percent to 12,357 from their pre-fence peak of 19,702 a year, while violent crimes have dropped more than 6 percent to 2,682 from a peak of 2,861 a year. The overall crime rate in El Paso continued to fall last year, prompting city leaders to trumpet the good news in a press release that noted, “Because El Paso is a border town, its low crime rate may surprise you.” Since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half El Paso City Manager Tommy Gonzalez boasted that the city will “continue to lead our country in public safety.” Another core promise made by Trump to justify constructing a massive wall spanning from Texas to California is that it will slow the flow of drugs coming across the border from Mexico. “We need the wall for security. We need the wall for safety,” Trump said last week while answering questions about the sweeping new GOP immigration bill. “We need the wall for stopping the drugs from pouring in.” On that score, El Paso already has exceeded expectations. Drug smuggling along that border entry point has also fallen dramatically. In fact, since the fence was completed, the volume of marijuana and cocaine coming through El Paso and seized by Border Patrol agents has been cut in half. The year before the wall was fully built in 2010, the volume of illegal drugs confiscated by the feds along the El Paso border hit 87,725 pounds. The year after, the amount of drug seizures plummeted to 43,783 pounds. Last year, they dropped even further to a total of 34,329, according to Border Patrol reports obtained by The Post. All told, a legion of empirical evidence supports the idea a southern border wall could, in fact, work. There is also anecdotal evidence. In local press accounts, El Paso residents and business owners alike have praised the fence, citing it as an effective deterrent to both illegal crossings and crime. see also Border Patrol busts drop to 46-year low Arrests by Border Patrol agents dropped to a 46-year low... Now Trump plans to build a possibly bigger deterrent. The existing fence along the El Paso sector, which is made of a combination of corrugated steel and metal meshing, towers 21-feet high at some points and is already hard to climb. But the Trump wall, which will begin construction in El Paso, will be even taller and have multiple layers of security. Still, Democratic leaders are adamantly opposed to it. They argue the $18 billion wall won’t work to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs, and will only be a massive waste of tax dollars. “We think, frankly, the building of the wall, its cost is not justified either by its efficiency or effectiveness,” House Minority Whip Rep. Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said Thursday. Even local Democrats are arguing with success. “That wall in itself is a racist reaction to a racist myth that does not reflect the reality of this country at all,” said Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-El Paso). Paul Sperry is a former Hoover Institution media fellow and author of several books, including the bestseller “Infiltration.”",partially false
"by Sen. Doug Whitsett More than a dozen bills relating to firearms were introduced during the recently concluded 77th Legislative Assembly. Most of those bills would have, in some way, impinged upon our second amendment right to own and bear firearms. A few of the more aggressive bills included: • House Bill 3200 that would have created the crime of unlawful possession or transfer of an assault weapon or large capacity magazine, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, or both. • House Bill 3413 that would have created the crime of endangering a minor, by allowing the minor access to a fire arm, punishable by up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $6,250, or both. • SB 347 that would have allowed each school district to establish their own rules regarding the right to carry a licensed concealed weapon on school property. Violation of the law would have constituted criminal trespass, resulting in penalties of up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $6,250, or both. This bill would also have preempted the current law that only allows the legislative body to create laws regulating firearms. • SB 699 that would have restricted the right to carry a concealed weapon in the capitol building by most licensed people without the written permission of the legislative administration. • SB 700 that would have required completion of a background check, before any firearm could be transferred between private parties. Failure to complete the background check could have resulted in penalties up to 5 years in prison, fines up to $125,000, or both. • SB 758 that would have required the owner of a firearm to carry specific liability insurance on each firearm in their possession. It also made it a crime to transfer a firearm to another person unless that individual carried liability insurance on the weapon. Failure to maintain liability insurance on each firearm would have resulted in fines of up to $10,000 per firearm. • SB 796 that would have required completion of a concealed handgun course, including a live fire test, before a concealed handgun license could be issued. It is unclear why our legislature should focus its attention on increasing the requirements to obtain a concealed carry permit. It seems that no one can remember the last time that an Oregon handgun licensee committed a crime with a firearm. Each of these bills, except HB 3413, had an emergency clause attached. The only reason for the emergency clause would have been to prevent the bill from being referred to the people to decide. None of these bills were enacted into Oregon law. The primary reason that the bills did not pass was because the Senate Leadership knew that the combined 15 no votes of 14 Senate Republicans, and of Senator Betsy Johnson, would have defeated each of the bills on the Senate floor. For that reason, they were never allowed to come to the Senate floor for a vote. From my perspective, that vote count is much too close for comfort. Your Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law. It was within one vote of grossly impinging on our second amendment rights. Unfortunately, too many people are simply unaware of the facts regarding the possession of guns, and the commission of gun related crimes. In fact, most families have been convinced by media reports that gun related crimes are on the increase in America. That simply is not true! Over the past twenty years, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States has decreased by nearly 40 percent. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has also plummeted, declining by nearly 70 percent. Unintended deaths by firearms have dropped by nearly 60 percent since 1993, and have decreased by more than 80 percent since 1929. This dramatic decline in the number of crimes committed with firearms has occurred during the same time period when our national population has increased from 250 million to 315 million people. During the same twenty years, more than 100 million guns have been sold to private citizens in the United States. Forty three percent of U.S homes now report that they possess one or more firearms. I would imagine that the gun owning percentage is actually much higher than reported, because many people who own firearms do not prefer to let anyone know that they have those weapons. All indicators point to the fact that our society becomes safer as more responsible families own guns. Nonetheless, gun violence is the third most often reported event by our news media. That rate of reporting is only surpassed by news reports on traffic and the weather. The media almost never reports the daily events where violence is prevented by an armed citizen. It is this constant media bias that is primarily responsible for people believing that gun violence is on the increase. In my opinion, our most important right, as citizens of the United States, is our constitutionally guaranteed Second Amendment right to own and bear firearms. Throughout recorded history, each and every would-be dictator and despot has first convinced the people to disarm, allegedly in order to make their society a safer and more peaceful place to live. Once they have given up their firearms they have been systematically stripped of all other human rights.

"WHEELING — At least $53 million a week in illegal drugs cross the Mexican border into the U.S. each week, and more border agents are needed at the U.S.-Mexican border to stop this, according to U.S. Rep. David B. McKinley.  McKinley, R-W.Va., recently traveled to the U.S.-Mexican border to learn about the issue there first hand. He visited the McAllen, Texas region in the Rio Grande District of the U.S. Border Patrol.  He commended the work of the border agents.  “They put themselves in danger and try to keep the border clean and secure. They’ve done that for decades,” McKinley said. “What has compounded this is the humanitarian crisis. We didn’t always have so many people trying to cross illegally.”  The agents attempt to still do their security job, put many are being pulled off the line to take care of the humanitarian crisis.  While at the border, McKinley learned a Mexican drug cartel controls happenings at the border.  He spoke with immigrants detained at the border who told him they paid the cartel anywhere from $3,000 to $9,000 to get them across the border. Often, part of the deal is that the immigrant carry illegal drugs with them on the journey.  If the immigrants are captured, they are sent back to their village and must start over again and seek help from the cartel, McKinley said.  “One of the border officers said they the cartel might be making as much money on this as they are on drugs,” he said.  Border guards have a lot of tools to help track immigrants crossing into the U.S., even if they don’t have the manpower to stop all of them, according to McKinley.  The entire U.S.-Mexico border is about 2,000 miles long, while the Rio Grande District agents focus on a specific 300-mile area. Sections of the Rio Grande River are narrow, and often the water is so low immigrants can walk across it. Border guards showed McKinley the footsteps in the mud where some had walked across the night before.  Where there isn’t a wall, cameras and sensors are placed to indicate when an immigrant is coming across the border.  But the cartel knows when agents could be as far as 10 miles away from a possible passage and unable to stop it. That’s when they help immigrants cross into the U.S., according to McKinley.  Nearly a million immigrants were stopped at the border before entering the U.S. last year, he said. Rio Grande District agents were responsible for 399,000 of the arrests, but they know from their technology they missed at least 47,000 immigrants in their crossing.  Many of these immigrants entering the U.S. carried opioids, according to McKinley.  “Border agents say you’ve got to pay attention to this — $53 million a week is coming across the border in drugs,” he said.  To compare, the state of West Virginia recently received $28 million for opioid rehabilitation, treatment and education.  “Almost twice that amount comes across the border each week — to put it into perspective,” McKinley said.",partially false
"A measure to limit Florida school board member terms has gained the support of the two men seeking the Republican nomination to become the state's next governor. They did not weigh in, though, on the other two provisions the concept is tied to as it heads to the November ballot. U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis, a Jacksonville Republican in his third term, isn't one to talk much about Florida-specific issues. He did, however, take time to publicize his position on school board term limits, perhaps the most popular of the three ideas in the constitutional amendment. It also asks voters to require civics literacy program in public schools, and to allow the Legislature to create new education models outside the control of local school boards. ""No elected office, whether federal or local, is ever better off when run by career politicians,"" DeSantis, a three-term House member from Jacksonville, wrote in a piece for the U.S. Term Limits website. ""That's why I support eight-year term limits for all school board members,"" continued DeSantis, who also has sponsored legislation to limit Congressional terms. ""I am confident this proposal would bring new energy and ideas to school boards, which too often suffer from the same untamed incumbency that paralyzes Congress."" Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, by most accounts a the candidate more likely to focus on policy details, shared that point of view. ""If term limits are good enough for the governor and the Legislature, they're good enough for school boards,"" Putnam said via email. Supporters of Amendment 8, the Constitution Revision Commission's education-focused ballot question, have focused attention on the term limits portion. The new political committee backing the measure this week referred to the proposal in its press release as being about ""school board term limits and other K-12 policy."" It's that ""other"" part that has opponents most concerned. They have taken to social media to complain that the section ""amending Section 4 of Article IX of the State Constitution to specify which schools are operated, controlled, and supervised by a school board"" could establish a second level of public schools run without local control, with appointed boards based in Tallahassee or elsewhere. The original language, before the Constitution Revision Commission amended it, spoke directly of a state charter school authorizer.

"Have an important tip? Let us know. Email us here.  Keep up to date with our latest:  An Emergency Order from the Biden administration’s Department of Energy shows Texas energy grid operator ERCOT was instructed to stay within green energy standards by purchasing energy from outside the state at a higher cost, throttling power output throughout the state ahead of a catastrophic polar vortex.  Major smoking gun! Infowars has been sent a Department of Energy document, confirmed to be authentic, showing Texas begging for federal authorization to increase power!  Going into effect Sunday, Feb. 14, Emergency Order 202-21-1 shows the Energy Dept. was aware of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott’s statewide disaster declaration and that ERCOT was readying gas utilities in preparation for a demand surge.  The order shows Acting Energy Secretary David Huizenga did not waive environmental restrictions to allow for maximum energy output, instead ordering ERCOT to utilize all resources in order to stay within acceptable emissions standards – including purchasing energy from outside the state.  “ERCOT anticipates that this Order may result in exceedance of emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, mercury, and carbon monoxide emissions, as well as wastewater release limits,” the order states. “To minimize adverse environmental impacts, this Order limits operation of dispatched units to the times and within the parameters determined by ERCOT for reliability purposes.”  Moreover, the order instructed an “incremental amount of restricted capacity” to be sold to ERCOT at “a price no lower than $1,500/MWh,” an increase of over 6,000 percent over February 2020 prices of $18.20.  On Wednesday, the Dallas Business Journal reported, “Electricity on the Texas grid has averaged about $1,137.33 per megawatt hour so far in February, up from $18.20 per megawatt hour in February 2020, according to data from the Electricity Reliability Council of Texas. That’s a jump of more than 6,000 percent.”  Days later, the Public Utility Commission of Texas set prices at $9,000/MWh.  The EO shows the Biden administration basically ordered ERCOT to throttle its energy output by forcing it to comply with environmental green energy standards, while knowing full well Texans could freeze to death in their homes with zero electricity as temperatures plunged into the single digits.

Both Moscow and Damascus have accused the group of helping to stage a chemical attack in the Eastern Ghouta town of Douma on April 7.

We noted the participation of the United Nations Office UNO in the evacuation of the White Helmets, the UNO confirmed their involvement in these events.

"The worst murderers should be given a chance to escape staying in prison for life by pleading guilty, according to new rules drawn up for judges The worst murderers should be given a chance to escape staying in prison for life by pleading guilty, according to new rules drawn up for judges. The say a judge should take a killer's confession to the court into account when deciding whether they should be kept behind bars for good with a whole-life term. The proposal by the Sentencing Council, the body led by judges which instructs judges and magistrates on the punishments they should hand down, allows the possibility of eventual freedom to even the most evil murderers if they admit their guilt at the earliest opportunity. Critics warned yesterday that if the new sentencing rule goes into effect it could act as encouragement to murderers. Criminologist Dr David Green of the Civitas think tank, a former Home Office adviser on crime statistics, said: 'If someone knows they could get a lighter sentence if they own up, that could make them more inclined to kill.' The new murder sentencing rule is contained in a consultation document published by the Council, which lays down guidelines for judges and magistrates which they must follow unless they believe it would be unjust to do so. The paper suggests new guidance for the courts on what leniency should be shown to criminals who plead guilty. Murder sentences have been regarded as different from those imposed for all other crimes ever since the abolition of the death penalty in 1965. Those convicted of murder are always given a life sentence, but the judge also sets a real term of years that the killer will be made to serve in prison before release. The Sentencing Council said last year that 56 murderers were serving whole-life terms, which mean that they will never leave prison. These include Levi Bellfield, killer of Milly Dowler and two other women; alongside other serial murderers Peter Sutcliffe, Ian Brady, Dennis Nilson and Rosemary West. The new proposal, which will now go through a three-month consultation process before the Council decides whether to put it into effect, says that 'a court should consider the fact that an offender has pleaded guilty to murder when deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole life term.' The paper said this is one of 'some differences' from the existing murder sentencing rules, set down by the Council's predecessor body, the Sentencing Guidelines Council, in 2007. Different guidance on whole life terms for murderers, it said, is included to reflect a 2005 Court of Appeal decision on murder sentencing. Under the new proposal, the paper said, 'the draft guideline explicitly states that the fact that an offender has pleaded guilty may be taken into account in deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole life term.' It added that 'murder is the most serious criminal offence and the sentence prescribed is different from all other sentences.' The 2005 Appeal Court judgement on murder sentencing and guilty pleas, handed down by then Lord Chief Justice Lord Phillips and two other judges, considered sentences in two murder cases. The Appeal judges said: 'The court should consider the fact that the defendant has pleaded guilty to murder when deciding whether it is appropriate to order a whole life term.' However this decision was not included in the sentencing rules for murder handed down to judges in 2007. A spokesman for the Sentencing Council said: 'The practice in the courts will be unchanged. Judges have to follow the decisions set down by the Court of Appeal.' The Sentencing Council said last year that 56 murderers were serving whole-life terms, which mean that they will never leave prison. These include Levi Bellfield pictured, killer of Milly Dowler and two other women; alongside other serial murderers Peter Sutcliffe, Ian Brady, Dennis Nilson and Rosemary West The Council also said that general criminals who do not plead guilty at the first opportunity should get a lesser cut in their sentence. The bonus for an early guilty plea should remain a third off the sentence, it said, but those who plead guilty later in the court process should get only a fifth off their sentence rather than a quarter. The Sentencing Council chairman, Appeal judge Lord Justice Treacy, said: 'We want those who have committed crimes to admit their guilt as early as possible. When they do, it means victims and witnesses can be reassured that the offender has accepted responsibility for what they have done and that they are spared having to appear at court to testify. 'It also means that the police and Crown Prosecution Service can use their resources more efficiently to investigate and prosecute other cases.' But Dr Green said: 'If a judge is considering a whole life sentence it must be a case of truly evil murder. The sole consideration should be how strong a message of disapproval society wants to send. It should be sending the strongest possible message.",FALSE
"RUSH: Trump backs out of the Paris accords. Oh, do we have news on climate change today based on what happened in a courtroom in California. Let me give you the bare upshot of this. There’s a lawsuit being filed against the fossil fuel companies like Exxon and Texaco and — there’s five of ’em. And the suit has been brought by environmentalist wackos. They claim that all of these fossil fuel companies know that they are destroying the planet and are hiding the evidence. They claim in their lawsuit that they know that their business is creating the circumstances that cause climate change. So they filed this massive lawsuit. The judge in this case decided to have a little seminar before the trial actually began. And the climate change environmentalist wackos thought, “Oh, my God, this is a godsend. We’re gonna get to go in and we’re gonna rip these people a new one even before the trial begins.” But what happened was the judge is an educated and informed person when it comes to climate change, even though the judge is in California. And the upshot of it is that the environmentalist wackos were made fools of. They demonstrated they are lying. For example, one of these they said they had was a smoking gun memo, a smoking gun memo at Exxon and some of these other fossil fuel companies where they admit to themselves, internal memo, that they are destroying the planet, that they are engaging in activities causing massive amounts of C2O, causing greenhouse gases and the planet only has so much time. So the judge said, “Well, let me see. You say they’ve got it. Where is it? What does it say?” And the fossil fuel companies eagerly produced it. You know what it was? It was a slideshow from a U.N. presentation on the international committee of planetary whatever, the IPCC, whatever that stands for. It was simply a slideshow that the U.N. put together, that the environmentalist wackos have been lying about claiming it’s a smoking gun memo from the fossil fuel companies. The judge just made mincemeat of these people, demonstrated they’re lying, demonstrated they don’t know what they’re talking about and that there is no substance to their allegations at all. This is before the trial even began. And the trial has not yet begun. This was a preliminary stage. So the wackos have to go back now and reformulate their whole plan since their basic approach has just been nuked in court, since they have been exposed as lying, making things up. And, of course, everybody that believes in climate change believes what these wackos have been saying, so the world thought that these companies were gonna have their hats handed to ’em even before the trial began. And what ended up happening was the judge exposing the slime tactics of the environmentalist wackos. RUSH: I mentioned earlier in the program that the environmentalist wackos had their lunch handed to ’em in court out in California. I want to give you the details of this. ‘Cause any time there is a win, I’m gonna tell you about it. Any time there’s a reason for optimism, I’m gonna tell you about it. Any time the left takes it on the chin, I’m gonna tell you about it. Now, the Drive-Bys have reported the story, but they haven’t gone anywhere near what is really salient about it.I have here a column in the Wall Street Journal by Phelim McAleer. “Climate Alarmists May Inherit the Wind — They likened a courtroom ‘tutorial’ to the Scopes Monkey Trial. But their side got schooled.” Here’s the upshot of this story. “Five American oil companies find themselves in a San Francisco courtroom. California v. Chevron is a civil action brought by the city attorneys of San Francisco and Oakland, who accuse the defendants of creating a ‘public nuisance’ by contributing to climate change and of conspiring to cover it up so they could continue to profit.” Again, civil action, not criminal, meaning there would be damages if Big Oil is found liable here. And essentially the Drive-Bys and the environmentalist wackos thought they had stumbled across a brilliant maneuver, and that is to have global warming and climate change codified in law by having a court acknowledge that it exists and find these defendants liable. That was their plan. There was no date for the trial so far. However, on March 21st, a mere 10 to 11 days ago, “the litigants gathered for a ‘climate change tutorial'” that was ordered by the judge. The judge’s name is William Alsup. Now, the environmentalist wackos thought this was a gift from nirvana, since they don’t believe in heaven. They couldn’t believe their good luck, a climate change tutorial. You have to remember who these people are. The biggest obstacle that we’re up against in America, aside from the cultural rot, but I think the reason the cultural rot is taking place is we’re up against genuine stupidity. Too many generations have literally been taught nothing, including how to think. And so we’re up against — you may want to call it ignorance, but we’re up against genuine stupidity. And even among these environmentalist wackos and these city attorneys, they believe all of this claptrap that they have been saying about climate change all of these years, even though there isn’t any evidence for it. There isn’t any warming. All they’ve got is computer model predictions, folks. There isn’t yet any empirical evidence for their claim that greenhouse gases even cause temperatures to increase. There isn’t any empirical data for that. All of this is based on the come: Oh, my God, this is terrible, we can’t afford not to wait, we have to stop it. But there isn’t any truth. Not to mention the fact the last 15 years there hasn’t been any warming. Also, NOAA has been caught cheating and altering the annual temperature charts to show more warming than there has been, but it doesn’t matter. Because all of these environmentalist wackos and everybody who believes them and their city attorneys, they literally believe this stuff, just like they literally believe all the things they hate Trump for, they literally believe this. Like they believe Russia colluded with Trump, but it didn’t happen, there isn’t any evidence, but they’re convinced, they believe it. They’ve been saying it so long, thinking it so long, it’s gotta be true. So they walk into this courtroom, and they’re thinking this is it, this is where they’re gonna win every case. They’re gonna have a firmly established by a judge now that there is climate change. And once a court says it, that ends it, it doesn’t matter what other scientists say, it’s over. And that’s what they thought they were on the verge of, they were so excited. They could not contain themselves. But they didn’t know about Judge William Alsup. The environmentalist wackos were so excited about this that they had spectators, they had a giant crowd gathered outside the courtroom at 6 a.m. on March 21st, urged on by the advocates and their websites. And there were all kinds of signs, “Buckle up, polluters! You’re in for it now.” And they said this is gonna be the equivalent of the Scopes Monkey Trial. But in the end, it did not go well for the environmentalist wackos. And not for lack of legal talent. “Steve W. Berman, who represented the cities, is a star trial lawyer who has made a career and a fortune suing corporations for large settlements, including the $200 billion-plus tobacco settlement in 1998.” He was one of those lawyers. Michael Burger of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, told one of the websites getting the crowd to show up, “Until now, fossil fuel companies have been able to talk about climate science in political and media arenas where there is far less accountability to the truth.” Now, wait just a minute. Before we go further, stop and think of this line: “Until now, fossil fuel companies have been able to talk about climate science in political and media arenas where there is far less accountability to the truth.” In other words, if you want truth, do not involve journalism. If you want to find the truth, do not go anywhere near politics or journalism, because there isn’t any accountability to the truth in journalism. That, to me, is a humongous indictment, and that comes from a pro-climate change lawyer.“Judge Alsup started quietly. He flattered the plaintiffs’ first witness, Oxford physicist Myles Allen.” Judge Alsup called this physicist from Oxford a genius. He set him up. This guy’s standing there feeling his oats, he’s a genius, climate science genius, judge knows it. But then the judge reprimanded this physicist “for using a misleading illustration to represent carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and a graph ostensibly about temperature rise that did not actually show rising temperatures.” So the wackos, they brought their charts, and they brought their graphs, and their charts and graphs are made up BS. And they always have been. And the judge called an Oxford physicist, I mean, the epitome of a white lab coat scientist. And this guy was chopped off at the knees. The judge chastised this guy for using a misleading illustration to show carbon in the atmosphere. In other words, there wasn’t nearly as much in the atmosphere as this guy’s chart showed. And his graph about temperature increase did not show temperature increase. He just brought a complicated bunch of charts and graphs, said this is what it represents. The judge said, “Wait, what is that? What is that? What is that?” The judge illustrated that they were using bogus data so now they’re thinking, uh-oh, we got somebody who knows what we’re talking about here in the form of a judge. They thought, a San Francisco judge? This is gonna be a cakewalk. “Then the pointed questions began. Gary Griggs, an oceanographer at the University of California, Santa Cruz, struggled with the judge’s simple query: ‘What do you think caused the last Ice Age?'” Now, stick with me on this. “What caused the last Ice Age?” Remember, they are there to claim that all of these oil companies are causing uncontrollable warming. The judge says, “What do you think caused the last Ice Age?” The professor — you ready for this? — the professor said, well, there was a wobble in the earth’s orbit. And he went to describe the period, quote, “before there were humans on the planet,” which “we call hothouse Earth.” “‘That was when ‘all the ice melted. We had fossils of palm trees and alligators in the Arctic,’ Mr. Griggs told the court. He added that at one time the sea level was 20 to 30 feet higher than today. Mr. Griggs then recounted ‘a period called “snow ballers,”‘ when scientists ‘think the entire Earth was frozen due to changes in things like methane released from the ocean.'” Remember, these accounts of two apocalyptic climate events occurred naturally from a witness for plaintiffs hoping to prove that oil companies are causing warming and he was forced to admit that both warming and cooling happened in catastrophic ways long before there were oil companies. They were forced to deal with their actual claims, and a judge made mincemeat of them! They finally had an opponent who was informed and not sympathetic like the media is, and they were so embarrassed, and maybe more so than they even have the ability to understand. RUSH: One more thing about this tutorial in the San Francisco court with the environmentalist wackos suing five American oil companies for causing climate change and knowing it, polluting greenhouse gases and knowing it. The judge handed lunch to these people. The environmentalist wackos were humiliated and embarrassed in one other way. The plaintiff’s lawyer made a claim that there was a smoking gun document that the oil companies had, a memo that they had sent and read, prepared for each other that admitted they were polluting, admitted that fossil fuels as a business caused climate change. So the judge asked to see it. “The plaintiffs alleged that the oil companies were in possession of ‘smoking gun’ documents that would prove their liability,” and one of the lawyers, Theodore Boutrous, “said this was simply an internal summary of the publicly available 1995 IPCC report,” which is a U.N. organization. So the environmentalist wackos claimed there is a smoking-gun document that proves the oil companies know they are polluting. The judge asked to see it. What it turns out to be is nothing more than a United Nations-written internal summary of the publicly available U.N. 1995 International Panel On Climate Change report. The oil companies didn’t write it. It’s not a smoking gun. All it was was a political document written by the U.N. that was available publicly. It was a summary, you know, like two pages to summarize what’s in 500 pages. They got caught lying! The environmentalist wackos were lying claiming there was a smoking gun memo and document when it turns out it was nothing more than a U.N. summary of a report they had written in ’95 blaming the oil companies. “The judge said he read the lawsuit’s allegations to mean ‘that there was a conspiratorial document within the defendants about how they knew good and well that global warming was right around the corner. And I said: “OK, that’s going to be a big thing. I want to see it.” Well, it turned out it wasn’t quite that. What it was, was a slide show that somebody had gone to the IPCC and was reporting on what the IPCC had reported, and that was it. Nothing more.'”
There was no smoking-gun memo. The lawyers for the environmentalist wackos had totally made it up and lied about it. So they were on notice. The judge said, “If you want to respond, I’ll let you respond. Is there anything you want to say?” And the lawyer for the wackos said, “No.” Whereupon the judge adjourned the proceedings. This is all before the trial even starts, folks. And so they were smoked. They were exposed as the frauds that they are. It was shown how they’re making things up and lying, how the media simply regurgitates it because they even admit here, the media is nowhere to go for accountability to truth.

Despite an increase in employment, in-work poverty has gone up because of low pay and not enough hours of work/  The Joseph Rowntree Foundation JRF’s ‘state of the nation’ report on poverty found 56% of people in poverty are in a working family, compared to 39% 20 years ago.  Poverty has also increased for children and pensioners over the last five years, according to the research group.  The JRF research shows 14m people are living in poverty, including 4m children and 2m pensioners, up by 400,000 and 300,000 respectively over the past five years.  Union leaders said the findings showed a pressing need to ban zero-hour contracts and increase the minimum wage and head teachers said the country’s record on poverty was “truly shocking.”  Are you a struggling parent? Email webnews@mirror.co.uk  The highest poverty rates were in London, the North of England, the Midlands and Wales, and lowest were in the South, Scotland and Northern Ireland, according to the study.  The differences in poverty rates were often driven by the availability of good quality jobs and housing costs.  People were more likely to be in poverty if they lived in certain parts of the UK, in a family where there is a disabled person or a carer, if they work in the hospitality or retail sector, or if they live in rented housing.  JRF is urging the government to improve job security and quality, see the benefits system as an essential public service that loosens the grip of poverty, and help make more low-cost housing available.  Image: Julian Hamilton/Daily Mirror  Claire Ainsley, JRF executive director, said: “The new Government has an historic opportunity as we enter the 2020s.  “Past successes in recent decades show that it is possible for the UK to loosen the grip of poverty among those most at risk, but this progress has begun to unravel and it will take sustained effort across the country and throughout the governments of the UK to unlock poverty.  “Millions of families care for each other, raise their children and work hard without any guarantee that they will escape poverty, governments, employers and landlords all have a role to play in changing this.  “It’s not right that so many are unable to build a firm foundation to their lives because their jobs are insecure or they can’t find a home they can afford.  “Without a better deal for working families, and a social security system that provides a public service for all of us, the UK faces further division and deeper poverty.  “That better deal needs to encompass the basics we all need, from building new homes to funding social security and bringing better jobs to all parts of the country.”  Image: Getty Images  Frances O’Grady, TUC general secretary, said: “The Government must crack down on business models based on poverty pay and insecure jobs.  “Zero hours contracts should be banned and the minimum wage must go up to at least £10 an hour right away.”  JRF said the poverty indicator it used is when a family has an income of less than 60% of median income for their family type, after housing costs.  Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT, which found in a poll of members last year that 83% had seen an increase in the number of children coming to school hungry in the last five years, said: “School leaders are seeing more and more hardworking families struggling, and more children living in poverty.  “This country’s record on child poverty is truly shocking. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds have disproportionately suffered from cuts not just to education, but to all the wider services that should be there to help them.  “Successive governments have failed to invest in those who need it the most. This government must have the confidence to change that record.  “Schools are at the centre of efforts to improve equality of opportunity. But the issues that underpin inequality reach far beyond the school gates and exist throughout the communities that schools serve. Inequality will remain entrenched in the UK unless the government takes urgent action to break the grip of poverty.”",FALSE

"It’s no secret that Epstein and Schiff share a long history of perversion. Last year, it was revealed by the FBI that the two corresponded by email on several occasions, totaling 256 emails. But, according to the latest leak, it goes much deeper than just emails.  The reasons for the visits were not recorded, but based on the emails between the two men, we can assume they were for nefarious reasons.  An FBI insider has leaked the extensive visitor logs to Epstein Isle. Several notable names were mentioned in the log, including Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, and Nancy Pelosi. But the most frequent visitor was none other than Adam Schiff, who visited 78 times over the span of five years.  Chief Inspector of the Department of Investigation, Joe Barron, gave his thoughts about the case, saying the details were sickening.  “What we have discovered over the past few months has been disturbing, to say the least. This goes to very very highest levels. No one could have predicted this. Only the foil hats would have thought this to be possible. Schiff looks to be the ringleader of the operation, arranging the trades and handled the financing. I can’t say anything else since it’s a nonexistent investigation, but rest assured justice will be served. In America, no one is above the law, except the rich.”  This is truly sickening news, but not unexpected. It was well-known that Schiff and Epstein were in cahoots, but the fact that Epstein was one of the main figures behind the operation was unexpected. This explains the impeachment hoax, since he was looking for a distraction.  These people are in the highest levels of government and need to be found out and prosecuted.  We can’t have this type of behavior in America.",FALSE
"Ahead of Trump’s campaign relaunch, the Florida Democratic Party is previewing his track record of broken promises. Today’s focus is on how Trump abandoned workers. On June 18, Donald Trump shall descend on Orlando, Florida to hold a campaign kick-off rally. As Trump’s visit nears, the Florida Democratic Party reminds members of the media of Trump’s continued assault on workers for the enrichment of corporate titans. The Trump administration has given corporations a $1 trillion tax cut — with almost nothing going into the pockets of workers — while at the same time, gutting workers rights, consumer protections, and denying 4.2 million American workers overtime. Trump’s economic record deserves media scrutiny ahead of his campaign kick-off. Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried stated: “Donald Trump should launch his anti-worker, anti-woman, anti-farmer, and anti-minority campaign elsewhere. We are a diverse, growing, and strong state that is increasingly rejecting his reckless, self-serving campaign rhetoric. He’s here because he knows he can’t win without Florida in 2020 — but we know Florida can only win without a second Trump term.” See for Yourself With Trump’s reelection kicking-off, news outlets can’t ignore the fact that Trump’s economic record is a disaster — unless you happen to make $1 million or more a year.

"A new study by researchers at Turku University in Finland found that the human contribution to a rise of 0.1°C in global temperatures over the last century is just 0.01°C. The paper, titled ‘No experimental evidence for the significant anthropogenic climate change’ was published by Jyrki Kauppinen and Pekka Malmi. The study found that, “During the last hundred years the temperature is increased about 0.1°C because of carbon dioxide. The human contribution was about 0.01°C.” Kauppinen and Malmi conclude that global temperatures are controlled primarily by cloud cover and that “only a small part” of the increased carbon dioxide concentration is anthropogenic. The study also calls into question the claims of the UN IPCC, which concluded that global temperatures are largely driven by human activity. While the methods and results of the study can be debated, this once again illustrates how there is no overwhelming consensus on man-made global warming as the media often claims. In reality, there are dozens of prominent scientists who believe that climate change is driven by natural forces or that the United Nations’ climate projections are unreliable.

"More nightmare fuel for boba lovers There has always been a certain level of fear mongering associated with bubble tea: the tapioca balls can present a choking hazard, may contain unapproved or unsafe additives in some cases, etc. Boba fans, I take no pleasure in reporting that this latest news does nothing to alleviate those fears: a 14-year-old girl in China’s Zhejiang province went to the hospital with an abdominal blockage apparently caused by around a hundred undigested tapioca pearls, as reported by AsiaOne and Chinese news outlets like EBC Dongsen News. According to the reports, the girl was taken to the hospital after she complained about stomach pains, couldn’t eat, and had been constipated for five days. The doctor performed a CT scan and reportedly found “unusual spherical shadows,” AKA undigested boba, dotting her colon all the way down her digestive system. According to EBC Dongsen News, the patient reluctantly admitted she had drank a bubble tea five days earlier; however, the doctor who treated her said it would have taken a lot more boba to get to this point. The doctor prescribed laxatives for the girl to get the undigested pearls out of her system. As EBC Dongsen News reports, the director of Zhuji People’s Hospital’s emergency department said that boba, being made of tapioca starch, are already difficult to digest, but some makers also use thickeners and preservatives, the significant consumption of which may lead to gastrointestinal problems.

"The opinions expressed by columnists are their own and do not represent the views of Townhall.com. On February 2, 1978—41 years ago!—The Wall Street Journal warned in a headline that “Low-Lying Lands Could Be Submerged by Climatic Disaster.” Fears of apocalyptic sea-level rise are nothing new despite the fact that they seem to have recently taken on a new life of their own, especially in South Florida, where I live. The only scientific correlation I can make with any certainty is that these fears rise in direct proportion to the number of socialists elected to Congress. So, let’s first talk about the science of climate change as it pertains to sea-level rise. Dr. Roy Spencer, who has a Ph.D. in meteorology, writing in An Inconvenient Deception, states that compared to Al Gore’s warnings of a sea-level rise of 20 feet, the actual measurement is one inch per decade for over 150 years with no observed acceleration. This could not be true if it were anthropogenic (human-caused), since there has been ample time for acceleration since 1940, “which is the earliest that humanity’s greenhouse gas emissions could have had any substantial effect.” Sea-level rise is a process that is mostly natural since it “predates the Industrial Revolution,” Dr. Spencer explains. This may be small comfort to the people living in Miami Beach, for example, where sea-level rise has been worse than the average. But a 2017 study reported that the land is sinking at a rate of 3 mm per year—equal to the sea-level rise—causing a doubling of the effect and magnifying the rise of water at lunar high tides. No one should “deny” climate change per se. It is a characteristic of the planet upon which we live. The argument boils down to how much of it is due to relatively recent anthropogenic increases of atmospheric carbon dioxide compared with the Earth’s natural climate fluctuations caused by other factors including solar activity. And it’s not just the science that is on the side of those appealing for moderation. Earth’s climate history also has a story to tell. A graph of the Earth’s mean temperature over the last 2,000 years shows two previous periods when temperatures were warmer than they are now; from 1–200 A.D., an epoch called the Roman Warm Period, and more recently the Medieval Warm Period from 900–1100 A.D. Historical records during the Medieval Warm Period report many benefits such as extended growing seasons, a reduction in infant mortality, and the explosive growth of Europe’s population. The Vikings colonized portions of Greenland and were able to plant warm-weather crops such as potatoes. It is worth noting that both of these climate optima occurred centuries before the discovery of fossil fuels and the invention of the internal combustion engine. Getting back to that 41-year-old Wall Street Journal headline, the article that accompanied it reported that the temperature rise due to the burning of oil and gas would result in a “sudden deglaciation of the West Antarctic, unfreezing enough water to raise world sea levels by five meters (about 16 feet).” It was further stated that such a sea-level rise could “result in the submergence of much of Florida, Holland and other low-lying areas in the next 50 years.” That scenario, though, depended on the worst-case scenario for greenhouse gas emissions, the worst-case scenario for warming, and the worst-case scenario for the effect of warming on the ice. None of those was at all likely, and none of them happened. It was far more likely that continental ice melt would continue at about the rate of the past thousands of years—about a foot per century, meaning it would take 1,600 years to achieve the feared 16-foot rise. And indeed that’s what’s happened. Sea level has continued to rise at about the same rate of a foot per century or 1.2 inches per decade. To achieve the 16 feet warned of 41 years ago in 50 years, the rate would now have to jump to 208 inches per decade—nearly 200 times as fast. Does anyone want to put a bet on that? If you’ve ever visited a new housing development, inland or along the coast, it doesn’t matter, you already know the sandy soil is littered with the shells of mollusks. Have you ever wondered why? A December 3, 1993, article that appeared in The Sun-Sentinel may have the grim news: “Rising and falling ocean levels complicate the geologic picture. The coast has shifted several times, which is why shells can be found far inland ….” Apocalyptic sea-level rise may simply be just a thing of the past. Gregory J.

"Piles of shredded ballots were located today in a dumpster in Maricopa County Arizona. This find occurs only days before the Senate’s audit of the county’s 2020 election results is due to start.  For months the Board of Supervisors in Maricopa County have blocked and delayed any independent audit performed by the Arizona Senate of the County’s results in the 2020 Presidential election. As we’ve reported previously, after being subpoenaed by the Arizona Senate and then suing the Senate to prevent a Senate audit of their 2020 election results, the Maricopa County Board of Supervisors MCBOS agreed to have an audit if they could pick the auditors. The two firms they picked they claimed were the only two who were certified by the governmental body the US Election Assistance Commission EAC. However, we found that these firms were not certified at the time they were selected by the MCBOS:  The MCBOS went ahead and hired the firms they wanted to perform their audit but the audits were never structured to find any suspected fraud in the county. The validity of the 2 million ballots in the county was never even considered in the programs reportedly used by these audit firms:  TRENDING: BREAKING: Supreme Court Dismisses President Trump and Attorney Lin Wood's Final Election Challenge Without Comment  This is probably why these audits were set up the way they were so no fraud would be identified. The auditors came to Phoenix and performed their work and some patriots found out that they could be observed on cameras in the facility where they were doing the work. These patriots watched and even sent a couple of individuals down to the center to check things out late one night. These individuals were greeted with a network that was labeled “f##k you”.  And as we reported, the audits were unprofessional in other areas as well:  This is when the Arizona Senate said enough and passed a bill that would grant the Arizona legislature the authority to subpoena election records like ballots and tabulating equipment and ignore any laws to the contrary.  The Senate is now in the process of selecting an auditors to perform their audit. As the day for their audit approaches the heat must have gotten too hot for those guarding the ballots in Maricopa County.  Per our source on the ground in the County, yesterday an individual went by the Maricopa County Tabulation and election center and found doors wide open with seeming uninhibited access to the facility.  Today some other interested individuals in the county stopped by the same facility and found huge piles of ballots in the dumpster outside the facility.  Someone ordered the ballots be shredded.  We do not yet have the complete information on the shredded ballots.  This is not the first state where we found shredded ballots after the election.

"by Sen. Doug Whitsett More than a dozen bills relating to firearms were introduced during the recently concluded 77th Legislative Assembly. Most of those bills would have, in some way, impinged upon our second amendment right to own and bear firearms. A few of the more aggressive bills included: • House Bill 3200 that would have created the crime of unlawful possession or transfer of an assault weapon or large capacity magazine, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, a fine of up to $250,000, or both. • House Bill 3413 that would have created the crime of endangering a minor, by allowing the minor access to a fire arm, punishable by up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $6,250, or both. • SB 347 that would have allowed each school district to establish their own rules regarding the right to carry a licensed concealed weapon on school property. Violation of the law would have constituted criminal trespass, resulting in penalties of up to one year in prison, a fine of up to $6,250, or both. This bill would also have preempted the current law that only allows the legislative body to create laws regulating firearms. • SB 699 that would have restricted the right to carry a concealed weapon in the capitol building by most licensed people without the written permission of the legislative administration. • SB 700 that would have required completion of a background check, before any firearm could be transferred between private parties. Failure to complete the background check could have resulted in penalties up to 5 years in prison, fines up to $125,000, or both. • SB 758 that would have required the owner of a firearm to carry specific liability insurance on each firearm in their possession. It also made it a crime to transfer a firearm to another person unless that individual carried liability insurance on the weapon. Failure to maintain liability insurance on each firearm would have resulted in fines of up to $10,000 per firearm. • SB 796 that would have required completion of a concealed handgun course, including a live fire test, before a concealed handgun license could be issued. It is unclear why our legislature should focus its attention on increasing the requirements to obtain a concealed carry permit. It seems that no one can remember the last time that an Oregon handgun licensee committed a crime with a firearm. Each of these bills, except HB 3413, had an emergency clause attached. The only reason for the emergency clause would have been to prevent the bill from being referred to the people to decide. None of these bills were enacted into Oregon law. The primary reason that the bills did not pass was because the Senate Leadership knew that the combined 15 no votes of 14 Senate Republicans, and of Senator Betsy Johnson, would have defeated each of the bills on the Senate floor. For that reason, they were never allowed to come to the Senate floor for a vote. From my perspective, that vote count is much too close for comfort. Your Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law. It was within one vote of grossly impinging on our second amendment rights. Unfortunately, too many people are simply unaware of the facts regarding the possession of guns, and the commission of gun related crimes. In fact, most families have been convinced by media reports that gun related crimes are on the increase in America. That simply is not true! Over the past twenty years, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States has decreased by nearly 40 percent. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has also plummeted, declining by nearly 70 percent. Unintended deaths by firearms have dropped by nearly 60 percent since 1993, and have decreased by more than 80 percent since 1929. This dramatic decline in the number of crimes committed with firearms has occurred during the same time period when our national population has increased from 250 million to 315 million people. During the same twenty years, more than 100 million guns have been sold to private citizens in the United States. Forty three percent of U.S homes now report that they possess one or more firearms. I would imagine that the gun owning percentage is actually much higher than reported, because many people who own firearms do not prefer to let anyone know that they have those weapons. All indicators point to the fact that our society becomes safer as more responsible families own guns. Nonetheless, gun violence is the third most often reported event by our news media. That rate of reporting is only surpassed by news reports on traffic and the weather. The media almost never reports the daily events where violence is prevented by an armed citizen. It is this constant media bias that is primarily responsible for people believing that gun violence is on the increase. In my opinion, our most important right, as citizens of the United States, is our constitutionally guaranteed Second Amendment right to own and bear firearms. Throughout recorded history, each and every would-be dictator and despot has first convinced the people to disarm, allegedly in order to make their society a safer and more peaceful place to live. Once they have given up their firearms they have been systematically stripped of all other human rights. We must not allow glib-speaking politicians, and a complicit news media, to convince us that we are safer without firearms. We are not safer. We are defenseless.

"The New York Times had no idea in 1984 that a piece taking a deep dive into the life of an upcoming billionaire would eventually resurface as confirmation of just how PERFECT a fit President Trump is for this time in America. We pulled out the highlights for you below but the entire article is incredible. Who could have predicted in 1984? Well, it seems that The New York Times described brilliant businessman Donald J. Trump as a great future President of the United States… THE EXPANDING EMPIRE OF DONALD TRUMP: ‘DONALD! HEY, DONALD! DONALD!’ The men were yelling, eager to call him by name. A storm front of cigar smoke was gathering above the hotel ballroom, packed elbow-to-elbow for a breakfast-hour sports forum with a crowd that included some of New York’s most wealthy, powerful and famous men. He has no public-relations agent. His competitors wonder how this can be, but watching him at the sports forum provided an explanation. While executives of the other teams told the audience about problems of negotiation and arbitration, about dirty restrooms inside their arenas and street crime outside and about ‘attempting to move the Mets in the right direction,’ “He said further that he would ‘continue to create chaos’ for the N.F.L. and, by the way, that he planned to build a domed stadium in New York.” Donald Trump was electrifying the room the rat-a-tat-tat revelations, dropping names of star N.F.L. players and coaches he would sign in a matter of hours. IT IS NOT YET 9 AM SPENDING A DAY WITH Donald Trump is like driving a Ferrari without the windshield. It’s exhilarating; he gets a few bugs in his teeth. Although he is still interested in such ideas as putting up the world’s tallest building on the East River, his mind wanders from the business of New York real estate. He has told people in the communications industry that he is ‘very interested in communications,’ which is like a 2,000-pound gorilla mentioning that he is very interested in becoming carnivorous. The Trump touch. It has set some people in New York to outright Trump worship; they call him ‘a real-estate genius’ who has helped lead the city out of the darkness of the mid-1970’s into a new era of glamour and excitement. Mr. Trump does not take exception to that. Many urban-affairs experts view the developers as saviors of our postindustrial cities. ‘With manufacturing leaving,’ says George Sternlieb, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University, ‘and with Federal and state aid diminishing, our cities desperately need the rich. Cities are tending to fall into two categories: cities of consumption and cities with no economic base.’ The rich of the world can live anywhere they want, explain the experts; Mr. Trump leads them to New York. Sales taxes, user taxes, jobs and resulting payroll taxes are generated. That Mr. Trump was able to obtain the location, when every real-estate developer in the world would have done just about anything to get it, is testimony to Donald Trump’s persistence and to his skills as a negotiator. That he was able to put up a building of this dimension on this site demonstrates his finesse with the zoning code. ‘He has the uncanny ability to smell blood in the water,’ a competitor says. He obtained the air rights over Tiffany, which allowed him to build a much higher building, and went to Equitable, which sold him the land for a 50 percent interest in the project. The day before he has sent $3,000 to an unfortunate family he has red about in the newspaper, something he does frequently, according to Mrs. Foerderer. For a billion-dollar corporation, there aren’t too many people around. Donald Trump makes or approves practically all decisions. He does not seem to write anything down, keeping volumes of company files as mental notes. Says Louise M. Sunshine, executive vice president: ‘If it is not the impossible, Donald is simply not interested. There has to be creativity. Money ceased to be the object a long time ago.’ Mr. Trump agrees with this assessment. ‘He is an almost unbelievable negotiator,’ says Irving Fischer of HRH Construction. ‘I don’t worship at the shrine of Donald Trump,’ he says, ‘but our company has given up trying to negotiate costs with him. We just say: ‘Tell us what you want, you’re going to get it anyway.’ ‘Trump can sense when people might want to get out of a project,’ says a developer… He trusts his instincts and has the guts to act on them.’ Roy M. Cohn, Mr. Trump’s friend and attorney, adds: ‘He has an uncanny sense of knowing that something is a good deal when it looks dismal to everyone else.’ Such was his first deal in Manhattan, his purchase of the Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street in the mid-1970’s, when even the Chrysler Building across the street was in foreclosure. Fred Trump described his son’s efforts to buy the hotel as ‘fighting for a seat on the Titanic.’ But, Donald Trump says, ‘I saw all those people coming out of Grand Central Terminal, and I said to myself, ‘How bad can this be?” He completely renovated the hotel, reopening it as the chrome-and-glass Grand Hyatt Hotel. He had moved in quietly, sending 14 different people to purchase 15 parcels of land and keeping his name out of it. ‘If the seller was Italian,’ says Mr. Trump, ‘we sent an Italian’ – something he probably did not learn at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Finance, where he received a B.A. in economics in 1968. He bought and sold a few pieces of real estate in Philadelphia when he was bored with classes. ‘It’s in his genes,’ says Fred Trump, explaining his son’s success in real estate and recalling his three sons growing up on construction sites and in rental offices. ‘Donald Trump is the Michael Jackson of real estate,’ says Mr. Fischer. ‘We’ve been dealing with him since he was 16. He was an old trouper at age 25.’ His success also derives from his marketing skills. ‘I want to bring a little showmanship to real estate,’ Mr. Trumps says. He is often compared to the late William Zeckendorf, the renowned New York builder, who was said to owe much of his success to his personal flair. Other New York developers – including the Lefraks, the Rudins, the Tishmans, the Fishers, the Roses – go quietly about building more buildings than does Donal Trump, making their millions and keeping their names out of things. Some developers find Mr. Trump’s high-profile approach disagreeable, but most concede that it has worked for him. Preston Robert Tisch, a developer and chief operating officer of the Loews Corporation, who lost out to Mr. Trump in the battle over whose site would be chosen for the city’s convention center, concludes: ‘He captured the imagination of people to a greater degree than I could.’ The condominiums in Trump Tower are selling rapidly at what many believe are exorbitant prices, while less costly units in Museum Tower, for example, another ‘super luxury’ building a few blocks away, are not. According to a marketing study of four such buildings made by the rudential Insurance Company of America, Donald Trump seems to be the only person in New York who knows how to market superluxury apartments. How do you sell a one-bedroom apartment costin as much as a line item in the Department of Defense budget? ‘You sell them a fantasy,’ Mr. Trump explains. ‘He deserves full credit for his success,’ says another builder. ‘He spent $1 million on the waterfall in Trump Tower. No one else would have done that. If the building fails everyone will say: ‘Well sure, what jackass spends a million bucks on a waterfall?” ‘What sets Trump apart,’ says Ben V. Lambert, a real-estate investment banker, ‘is his ability to pierce through the canvas and get things done.He gets projects literally off the ground while others are having meetings and doing feasibility studies. But his real skill is putting together complex pieces of the puzzles: fiancing, zoning, parcels of land and such. This ethereal part of building is perhaps more important than the brick and mortar.’ ‘You don’t use the term ‘settlement’ with Donald.’ Mr. Trump does not place patience on his list of virtues. Workmen confirm a story that he paid $75,000 to truck several 40-foot trees from Florida to Trump Tower, where a tunnel was built into the building so the trees would not be damaged by frost. The 3,000-pound trees were then installed in the lower plaza of the atrium. Mr. Trump did not like the look. He ordered the trees removed, and, when workmen balked for 24 hours, Mr. Trump had the trees cut down with a chainsaw. He speaks slowly and softly and in the same casual manner to eminent architects an business moguls as to the coffee and sandwich vendor outside his casino-hotel. He is said, by acquaintances, to be generally even tempered and rarely seems ruffled. He is not given to unkind remarks and is nearly always in a positive frame of mind. I never think of the negative, he says. All obstacles can be overcome. He talks boastfully about his projects, but is uncomfortable talking about himself. He does not smoke and does not drink alcohol. He plays golf and tennis regularly. His wife describes him as an all-American boy who likes country music best and prefers a steak and baked potato to anything called cuisine. His father pulled Donald Trump out of a prep school because he didn’t want his son growing up with spoiled kids with $40 ball gloves, sending him instead to military school. His father bragged at the sports forum that he had taken the subway and saved $15 car fare. Mr. Trump seems to have maintained a detached view of his flood of fortune and publicity. He frequently mentions that all of the attention and success may well be fleeting. His friends say that he is not yet fully cognizant of his station. He loves to got to ’21’ for lunch and be impressed with all the wealthy, powerful, famous people, says an acquaintance. He doesn’t quite realize that he’s one of them. After dusk, he rides through the city on his way to the last appointment of the day, enjoying the lights that make the whole city sparkle like the inside of Trump Tower. He talked about his plans for the future, as much as anyone who operates on spontaneous combustion can. Asked to explain, he adds: What does it all mean when some wacko over in Syria can end the world with nuclear weapons? He says that his concern for nuclear holocaust is not one that popped into his mind during any recent made-of-television movie. He says that it has been troubling him since his uncle, a nuclear physicist, began talking to him about it 15 years ago. His greatest dream is to personally do something about the problem and, characteristically, Donald Trump thinks he has an answer to nuclear armament: Let him negotiate arms agreements – he who can talk people into selling $100 million properties to him for $13 million. Negotiations is an art, he says and I have a gift for it. The idea that he would ever be allowed to got into a room alone and negotiate for the United States, let alone be successful in disarming the world, seems the naive musing of an optimistic, deluded young man who has never lost at anything he has tried.

"By Guest Columnist MATTHEW CHARLES CARDINALE, CEO and news editor of Atlanta Progressive News As Atlanta’s City Council considers its next big moves on affordable housing and community development, decision-makers and stakeholders alike have the opportunity to benefit from a bold, cutting-edge policy tool: Affordable Housing Impact Statements. Much like an environmental impact statement or a fiscal impact statement, an Affordable Housing Impact Statement would specify the estimated impact of certain public policy decisions of the City Council on Atlanta’s affordable housing stock. The statement would be prepared by the Office of Housing and would look like this: ***** This legislation, if enacted, is estimated to have a projected impact upon the affordable housing stock of the City of Atlanta by: Adding ___ or decreasing ___ units affordable at 30 or below percent of the City of Atlanta Area Median Income (AMI); and Adding ___ or decreasing ___ units affordable between 30.01 and 50 percent of AMI; and Adding ___ or decreasing ___ units affordable at between 50.01 and 80 percent of AMI; and Adding ___ or decreasing ___ units affordable at over 80 percent of AMI. ****** The statements would be presented to Councilmembers before they vote on impacted legislation so that they are empowered with meaningful information about the consequences of their decisions as they’re making them. And the statements would be kept in a repository by the Municipal Clerk so that stakeholders can review the statements over time to see the trend of public policy and whether Atlanta is getting closer to, or further away, from, its goals. After my nearly 10 years of citizen advocacy before Atlanta’s Community Development/Human Resources Committee (CD/HR) on issues of affordable housing, I have become very familiar with the concerns of Councilmembers and the needs of Atlanta’s working families in connection with this issue. So, as a law student at Gonzaga University in Spokane, Washington, currently in my third year, I took the idea of Affordable Housing Impact Statements – an idea of Ben Howard, senior advocate, that was adopted by Georgia Stand Up’s policy platform in 2009 – and drafted a proposed ordinance for the City of Atlanta, implementing the idea. Due to the leadership of Chairman Andre Dickens and Councilman Michael Julian Bond, the draft ordinance was introduced at CD/HR in November 2014, and is pending there as a held paper: Atlanta has an affordable housing crisis that is getting worse every year. The cost of rental housing is getting higher and higher, and it is making it burdensome, if not impossible, for working class people–including those who work in Atlanta – to live in Atlanta. Tens of thousands of Atlanta households are cost-burdened, meaning they pay more than 30 percent of their income towards rent, according to a recent report by HR&A Advisors and Enterprise, Inc., on behalf of the City of Atlanta. This includes more than 25,000 cost-burdened renter households subsisting on $20,000 or less per year; and about 13,000 cost-burdened renter households making between $20,000 and $34,999 per year. People tend to think of the availability or lack of affordable housing as a product of market forces only, but public policy also plays a huge role. For example, routine decisions by the Atlanta City Council include land-use decisions that result in the loss of affordable units and replacing them with market-rate units, for example when a developer submits a proposal that clearly presumes the demolition of existing affordable units, like the San Lucia apartments by the Lindbergh Target. Other routine decisions that affect the housing stock include the acceptance of federal grant dollars like Community Development Block Grants for the production or rehabilitation of affordable housing. These grants can help meet the greatest unmet needs among Atlanta’s working families, if the units are appropriately targeted at 30 percent AMI. Impact statements would document the positive impact in terms of numbers of units and the income brackets of the households who will benefit. There are also bigger proposals already introduced or in the works, including: mandatory inclusionary zoning; land banks and land trusts; policies to deal with abandoned, foreclosed properties; and more. That is why this is an ideal time to enact Affordable Housing Impact Statements now, rather than later. That way we can have a meaningful, consistent way to document positive or negative impacts across a range of income brackets, as we consider each of these diverse proposals. Late last year, I had the opportunity to meet with Terri Lee, deputy commissioner of Planning and Community Development; and Derrick Jordan, interim director of the Office of Housing, to discuss their thoughts and concerns, which they also expressed to the CD/HR Committee. Since then, I have drafted an administrative memo, providing additional guidance on how such an impact statement could be composed; and proposed amendments to reduce the administrative burden on the Office of Housing. Also, the Council increased the Office of Housing’s staff in the most recent fiscal year budget, which is already in effect, so preparing these Impact Statements would be a funded mandate. We have a lot of work to do in terms of substantive policy making; and I think mandatory inclusionary upzoning, with a component for units at 30 percent AMI, and appropriate unit bonuses for developers, will be critical. I just think adopting an Affordable Housing Impact Statement reporting policy is a common sense next step, a step that is focused on process, to make sure that we are collecting information in a pro-active and consistent way. It can help us monitor and gauge the potential impacts of policy decisions as we make them. I think adoption of this policy would show the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that Atlanta is serious about addressing structural barriers to fair housing in an affirmative way. It also will show the world we are serious about leading the way on this important issue. If you agree that Affordable Housing Impact Statements are a good idea, please contact members the Atlanta City Council’s CD/HR Committee, including Chairman Dickens as well as Councilmembers Bond, Kwanza Hall, Ivory Young, Cleta Winslow, Keisha Lance Bottoms, and Joyce Sheperd.",TRUE
"ADVERTISEMENT Despite the closure of all tertiary institutions by the federal government, the Academic Staff of Universities Union (ASUU) has declared an indefinite strike after the expiration of its two-weeks warning strike. The national president of the union, Biodun Ogunyemi, announced the strike at a press conference in Abuja on Monday. “The union has decided to embark on total and indefinite strike from Monday 23,2020, ” he said. He said the union rejects the use of force to enrol on Integrated Payroll and Personal Information System (IPPIS). The National Universities Commission ordered universities across the country to close for a month, beginning from March 23, due to the outbreak of coronavirus. The union commenced its warning strike on March 9, 2020. Since the commencement of the strike, the government met with the union twice. ASUU is embarking on the strike over the non-payment of salaries of their members who failed to enrol into the federal government’s IPPIS, a payroll software mandated for all public officials. The government, last Thursday, also reached an interim agreement with striking university lecturers to integrate the University Transparency and Accountability Solution (UTAS) into the IPPIS. The IPPIS is the government’s accountability software that has been made compulsory for all public institutions, mainly for personnel payroll. ASUU is opposed to the use of IPPIS for lecturers, saying it does not consider some of the peculiar operations of universities. The lecturers’ union then developed its own UTAS which it wants the government to adopt for universities. More details later…",TRUE
"It has long been established that Democrats cheat in order to win elections. They have undocumented citizens cast votes for them, they have dead people vote for them, have people of color vote for them, and the list goes on and on.  No, they have sunk to a new low. Nancy Pelosi and her cronies seek to disrespect our troops even more than they have thus far through defunding and constant criticism of heroic acts. Pelosi announced today that she intends to bring forth a new bill that would disqualify members of the military who serve overseas from voting in the coming presidential election.  Most people automatically assumed that this was being proposed in response to Trump’s opposition to mail-in voting. A tit-for-tat situation. Pelosi knows that 95 percent of military personnel support Trump and saw an opportunity to eliminate those votes. The truth is actually much more sinister.  The announcement was met with snark and outrage from her Republican counterparts who called Pelosi an unAmerican fascist communist totalitarian Russian trader. The Speaker of the House was quick to respond:  “Voting is a privilege for Americans who will be affected by the decisions of the elected. Republicans have pointed this out to us many times. So I’m just playing along. Some of these young men and women have been out of country for years. Why should they get to vote? They don’t even live here. We need to strengthen our elections, not weaken them by allowing foreigners to participate. That’s essentially what these soldiers have become- foreigners. They’ve given up on being American by working for so long out of country. American elections are for Americans. There is some point to be made here, but I’ll figure that out later.”  Nancy Pelosi appears to be becoming quite senile in her old age.

"Source: Xinhua| 2021-02-15 21:35:37|Editor: huaxia Video Player Close - By intentionally misquoting professionals on a World Health Organization WHO team who have concluded their mission on COVID-19 origin-tracing in China, the Times, among some other Western media, have made themselves accomplices in politicizing the pandemic. - While China is committed to transparency and global collaboration in the fight against COVID-19, some Western media like the Times have no qualms about abusing their influence to mislead the public over China out of self-interest. BEIJING, Feb. 15 Xinhua -- About a century ago, Walter Lippmann, known by many as the Father of Modern Journalism, criticized The New York Times for distorting reports on Russia and seeing not what was, but what men wished to see. While the Times' tradition to push a narrative instead of presenting the facts has long predated its highly biased reporting on China's fight against COVID-19, its latest step to twist facts to suit its anti-China agenda represents a new low for the daily. By intentionally misquoting professionals on a World Health Organization WHO team who have concluded their mission on COVID-19 origin-tracing in China, the Times, among some other Western media, have made themselves accomplices in politicizing the pandemic. Though the Times was at the vanguard when it came to pointing out conspiracy theories and lies churned out by the former U.S. administration of Donald Trump, it has more than its fair share distorted reality when it comes to reporting on China. Take its latest misleading account of the trip to China by the WHO expert team as an example. By selectively misquoting WHO experts to leave the impression that those scientists were endorsing the falseness of a report, the Times again attempted to frame China as lacking transparency. In the report, those WHO scientists were depicted as typically mild-mannered. Shortly after the report was published, two of those mild-mannered interviewees slammed the Times for misquoting them and stressed that the fabricated accounts by the Times was NOT my experience. Shame on you @nytimes! As Peter Daszak, a British zoologist and a member of the WHO expert team, tweeted. For the past months, the world has borne witness to how a politicization of the pandemic could hinder the global campaign against the once-in-a-century health crisis. Unfortunately, even now, some Western politicians and media like the Times are still spreading misinformation in pursuit of their geopolitical agenda against China. Photo taken on Feb. 9, 2021 shows a scene of the WHO-China joint study press conference in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province. Xinhua/Cheng Min While China is committed to transparency and global collaboration in the fight against COVID-19, some Western media like the Times have no qualms about abusing their influence to mislead the public over China out of self-interest. Those groundless accusations constitute a stark disrespect for the hard efforts of scientists from both China and the WHO, as well as malicious slander against China's achievements in the fight against COVID-19. As noted by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin, COVID-19 origin-tracing is a complex scientific issue involving many countries and regions, and should be carried out by global scientists in collaboration. For the global collaboration to succeed, mutual respect and trust must be guaranteed. China is unswervingly committed to building trust, but some Western politicians and media like the Times should keep in mind that trust is a two-way street. ■",partially false
"David Davis: There has long been an alternative to this discredited deal. It’s the Canada-style plan that Tusk and Barnier offered us.  David Davis is MP for Haltemprice and Howden, and is a former Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union.  The Spice Girls had it right when they said: ‘stop right now thank you very much’.  Yes, last week was another frenzied one in British politics. The Prime Minister’s proposed agreement with the EU has gone down like a lead balloon. I’m afraid it is a failure of nerve by the establishment. Their antics have led to the resignation of two Brexit Secretaries – myself and now Dominic Raab.  MPs, Party members and the British public are rightly dismayed. The consequence is that now there is speculation about the leadership of the Conservative Party.  This is not the Brexit they voted for. This proposal would keep the UK permanently trapped in EU institutions and under EU domination. This is not taking back control of borders, laws and money, which 17.4 million people voted for. It breaks our commitment to leave the Customs Union in the 2017 Conservative Manifesto. This proposed deal will never get through the Commons.  It really is time to stop right now, and say thank you very much.  So that’s where we are. But this is a time for calm heads. The crucial point is there is still time to save Brexit, still time to take control and still time to offer the British people a brighter future. This is the moment of truth. We can reject the proposed agreement and move on. We still have time because the key date in the calendar is 21st January, 2019. Only then does the Government need to make a statement within five days on what the United Kingdom plans to do, according to the European Union Withdrawal Act of 2018.  So, we can use the time until then productively. We know from past experience that the EU always leaves agreement to the final moment possible at the eleventh hour. Everybody in the UK wants the hope of a better deal – and trust me, we can do this. I spent countless hours negotiating with EU counterparts, and I know the great prize of a Canada-style free trade agreement is still possible. Indeed, it is very much still on. Both Michel Barnier and Donald Tusk have confirmed this.  Justin Trudeau said of his country’s free trade deal that it has created “good, well-paying jobs”, putting “food on the table for families”, helping to “grow and strengthen our communities” and ensuring that each generation is “better off” and has a “higher standard of living, than the one that preceded it.”  The question is how do we get there? It does not have to be like this. What we need now is leadership and the courage and confidence to deliver for the UK. We can deliver an honest and clean Brexit, leaving all the possibilities such as global free trade deals open for bright future. If we need to leave with no deal and negotiate a free trade agreement during the transition period, so be it. Let’s be clear and honest and tell the EU that’s what we are prepared to do.  As we leave the EU, our geography remains fixed. We remain an island maritime nation, outward-facing and trading across the globe. British goods and services are recognised as the best in the world, and are sought after by global customers. This cannot and will not change.  We can go back to the EU and say, if necessary, we are prepared to leave on world trade terms without a deal, but we would rather agree a positive way forward for all sides. We only need to be ready to trade under World Trade Organisation rules: international laws that regulate the trading relationships of 164 member states and around 98 per cent of global trade.  It in all our interests – the UK’s, the EU member states’ and most importantly the British people’s – that we start again and sort this our properly. Let us become, once again, a self-governing, free-trading nation. This is the best approach to unite the Conservative Party and address the huge concerns of MPs, members and activists.  Then we can stop being ‘always on the run’, look beyond Brexit – and provide the ‘human touch’ by focussing on issues like housing, education, health and crime that matter so much in the lives of families up and down our country.",FALSE

"A 30-year old man from Kentucky underwent some radical plastic surgery in order to physically resemble Jesus Christ. According to the Lexington Daily Tribune, Mark Emery has already been following Jesus’ footsteps in many different ways for several years, becoming a carpenter himself, as well as studying ancient Jewish law and religious texts. He went so far as to spend more than $215,000 on two years worth of plastic surgery to change his physical appearance to resemble Jesus. After undergoing a total of 21 surgical interventions, he claims to be “almost satisfied” with the results. “Some people buy fancy cars or fancy mansions… I use my money to show my love for Jesus by getting surgery to look more like him,” says Mr. Emery. “I try to live by his example and to be as much like him as I can. For me, acting like Jesus wasn’t enough, I really wanted to be like him and look like him.” The young man used various images and icons in order to determine the actual appearance of Christ before beginning his various surgeries. Many critics have already arisen in the social media, both denouncing or mocking Mr. Emery’s attempt to resemble Jesus Christ. Hundreds of people, including various religious leaders, have made some religiously oriented critics, denouncing as “blasphemy” or “heresy” his desire to physically imitate the appearance of Christ. “Christians love Jesus and try to act like him, not look like him. Shame on you. That’s ridiculous and anti-Christian” wrote Pastor John Hagee on his Twitter account. Many critics have also described Mr. Emery’s surgery as “ridiculous” since the physical appearance of Jesus Christ remains unclear and is still subject to a lot of debate. A special on PBS special put together a large study to determine what Jesus must have looked like, and this is the result they obtained. The Bible itself gives no physical description of Jesus in the sense of describing his skin tone, hair style, or facial traits. Many theories have been elaborated by scholars over the years, some of them incredibly far-fetched, claiming that Jesus could have been West African, Egyptian or half-Roman among others, but none of these claims were backed on any proof. It is generally accepted among historians, that Jesus was not of European descent, as he is usually depicted on icons and crucifixes. He would instead have resembled a modern-day Arab, Turk or other middle eastern man, having a slightly darker skin color. Despite all these critics, Mr. Emery says that he is really happy with the results of his surgery, claiming that he now feels closer to Jesus than he had ever felt in his life.",FALSE
"The shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown is an awful tragedy that continues to send shockwaves through the community of Ferguson, Missouri and across the nation. If I had been told to get out of the street as a teenager, there would have been a distinct possibility that I might have smarted off. But, I wouldn’t have expected to be shot. The outrage in Ferguson is understandable—though there is never an excuse for rioting or looting. There is a legitimate role for the police to keep the peace, but there should be a difference between a police response and a military response. The images and scenes we continue to see in Ferguson resemble war more than traditional police action. Glenn Reynolds, in Popular Mechanics, recognized the increasing militarization of the police five years ago. In 2009 he wrote: Soldiers and police are supposed to be different. … Police look inward. They’re supposed to protect their fellow citizens from criminals, and to maintain order with a minimum of force. It’s the difference between Audie Murphy and Andy Griffith. But nowadays, police are looking, and acting, more like soldiers than cops, with bad consequences. And those who suffer the consequences are usually innocent civilians. The Cato Institute’s Walter Olson observed this week how the rising militarization of law enforcement is currently playing out in Ferguson: Why armored vehicles in a Midwestern inner suburb? Why would cops wear camouflage gear against a terrain patterned by convenience stores and beauty parlors? Why are the authorities in Ferguson, Mo. so given to quasi-martial crowd control methods (such as bans on walking on the street) and, per the reporting of Riverfront Times, the firing of tear gas at people in their own yards? (“‘This my property!’ he shouted, prompting police to fire a tear gas canister directly at his face.”) Why would someone identifying himself as an 82nd Airborne Army veteran, observing the Ferguson police scene, comment that “We rolled lighter than that in an actual warzone”? Olson added, “the dominant visual aspect of the story, however, has been the sight of overpowering police forces confronting unarmed protesters who are seen waving signs or just their hands.” How did this happen? Most police officers are good cops and good people. It is an unquestionably difficult job, especially in the current circumstances. There is a systemic problem with today’s law enforcement. Not surprisingly, big government has been at the heart of the problem. Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement. This is usually done in the name of fighting the war on drugs or terrorism. The Heritage Foundation’s Evan Bernick wrote in 2013 that, “the Department of Homeland Security has handed out anti-terrorism grants to cities and towns across the country, enabling them to buy armored vehicles, guns, armor, aircraft, and other equipment.” Bernick continued, “federal agencies of all stripes, as well as local police departments in towns with populations less than 14,000, come equipped with SWAT teams and heavy artillery.” Bernick noted the cartoonish imbalance between the equipment some police departments possess and the constituents they serve, “today, Bossier Parish, Louisiana, has a .50 caliber gun mounted on an armored vehicle. The Pentagon gives away millions of pieces of military equipment to police departments across the country—tanks included.” When you couple this militarization of law enforcement with an erosion of civil liberties and due process that allows the police to become judge and jury—national security letters, no-knock searches, broad general warrants, pre-conviction forfeiture—we begin to have a very serious problem on our hands. Given these developments, it is almost impossible for many Americans not to feel like their government is targeting them. Given the racial disparities in our criminal justice system, it is impossible for African-Americans not to feel like their government is particularly targeting them. This is part of the anguish we are seeing in the tragic events outside of St. Louis, Missouri. It is what the citizens of Ferguson feel when there is an unfortunate and heartbreaking shooting like the incident with Michael Brown. Anyone who thinks that race does not still, even if inadvertently, skew the application of criminal justice in this country is just not paying close enough attention. Our prisons are full of black and brown men and women who are serving inappropriately long and harsh sentences for non-violent mistakes in their youth. The militarization of our law enforcement is due to an unprecedented expansion of government power in this realm. It is one thing for federal officials to work in conjunction with local authorities to reduce or solve crime. It is quite another for them to subsidize it. Americans must never sacrifice their liberty for an illusive and dangerous, or false, security. This has been a cause I have championed for years, and one that is at a near-crisis point in our country. Let us continue to pray for Michael Brown’s family, the people of Ferguson, police, and citizens alike. Paul is the junior U.S. Senator for Kentucky.",TRUE
"TIJUANA, Mexico — It’s the image from the unfolding crisis in Tijuana seen around the world: a migrant mom and her young children running away from a smoking tear gas canister with barbed wire and a forbidding metal wall in the background. Both children are clad only in T-shirts, and one appears to be wearing a pull-up diaper. One child is barefoot, another wears flip-flops. The woman clutching their arms and dragging them out of harm's way is wearing black leggings and a T-shirt emblazoned with the smiling cartoon faces of the Anna and Elsa from the Disney movie ""Frozen."" That jarring portrait was captured on camera Sunday by veteran Reuters photographer Kim Kyung-Hoon moments after a group of Central American migrants approached the border crossing into San Diego and were forced backwards by tear gas canisters hurled by U.S. border agents. ""When the tear gas started, some people were screaming and everybody started running away,” Kim told NBC News on Monday. ""I saw the woman and two children running away. One girl was barefoot from the beginning. The other was wearing beach sandals and lost them in the chaos."" NBC News also tracked down the woman, Maria Mesa, a 39-year-old mother of five from Honduras, inside a tent at the Benito Juarez Shelter in Tijuana. ""I grabbed my children and ran,"" Mesa said of her 5-year-old twin daughters Saira and Sheilly. Mesa said her 3-year-old son James, who does not appear in the picture, was also with them and fainted after getting a lung-full of gas. ""One of them could have died,"" she said. Kim said Mesa ""was travelling with five children."" ""Their father lives in Louisiana and they are trying to reach him,"" he said. Kim's photograph, which appeared on the NBC News website and on the front pages of numerous newspapers, provoked worldwide outrage and appeared to make a lie of President Donald Trump’s claim that the caravans were an invading force of ""criminals"" and ""gang members.""

The wire fence was on the other side of the river about 20 meters away."" Kim said he watched as the mother and the twins started fording the shallow river at the border. Asked if that was why the girls were wearing next to nothing, the photographer said he believes that was all the clothing they had. For a few seconds, Kim said, he was distracted by two men who had already made it across and were using their bare hands and a bucket to dig a hole under a fence so they could crawl under. Then, suddenly, the air was filled with choking smoke. ""One canister fell by the family and they started running away,"" he said, referring to the mother and twins. Migrants ride on the back of a truck while making their way to Tijuana from Mexicali, Mexico, on Nov. 20.

"The shocking reason why Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine requires storage at -70C ... because it contains experimental nanotech components that have NEVER been used in vaccines before  Lipid nanoparticles cause hyperinflammatory responses in the body, leading to severe reactions, hospitalization and potentially DEATH  UK government prepared for a vaccine death wave  Coronavirus vaccine deaths will be categorized as covid-19 deaths to keep the scam going  You're seeing the reports all over the news: Pfizer's new coronavirus vaccine requires storage at -70C -94F, which is much colder than the North Pole. If it's not stored at this temperature, its ingredients begin to break down and it fails to work. Currently Pfizer is claiming, without evidence, that its vaccine is 90% effective. But this claim is little more than corporate propaganda designed to drive up stock prices through false projections. But why do these vaccines need to be kept at -70C in the first place? The answer, it turns out, is because. As Children's Health Defense explained in an August 6th article , mRNA vaccines undergoing Covid-19 clinical trials, including the Moderna vaccine, rely on a nanoparticle-based “carrier system” containing a synthetic chemical called polyethylene glycol PEG. CHD goes on to explain: The use of PEG in drugs and vaccines is increasingly controversial due to the well-documented incidence of adverse PEG-related immune reactions, including life-threatening anaphylaxis. Roughly seven in ten Americans may already be sensitized to PEG, which may result in reduced efficacy of the vaccine and an increase in adverse side effects. If a PEG-containing mRNA vaccine for Covid-19 gains FDA approval, the uptick in exposure to PEG will be unprecedented—and potentially disastrous. Moderna documents and publications indicate that the company is well aware of safety risks associated with PEG and other aspects of its mRNA technology but is more concerned with its bottom line. Learn more about the super cold temperature requirements for the coronavirus vaccine in my Daily News Brief for Nov. 18th, 2020:Get more Daily News Briefs at the Health Ranger channel on Brighteon.com Why are LNPs Lipid Nanoparticles used in these vaccines? As CHD further explains: LNPs “encapsulate the mRNA constructs to protect them from degradation and promote cellular uptake” and, additionally, rev up the immune system a property that vaccine scientists tamely describe as LNPs’ “inherent adjuvant properties” In other words, the LNPs are, meaning they are designed to cause hyperinflammatory responses in human beings, once injected. This is done in an effort to induce the creation of antibodies that then allow the vaccine manufacturer to claim high effectiveness rates, even when those very same adjuvants cause severe adverse reactions. According to recent vaccine trials conducted by Moderna, 100% of human subjects in the high-dose vaccine trial group experienced adverse reactions.The adverse reactions caused by mRNA coronavirus vaccines are so widespread that the UK government recently admitted it is expecting a massive wave of coronavirus vaccine adverse reactions / side effects. As described in my previous article,  VACCINE DEATH WAVE: UK government posts bid for AI system to process the expected flood of COVID-19 vaccine injuries and side effects described as a 'direct threat to patient life' : The UK government has posted a bid and an award contract notice, seeking an Artificial Intelligence AI system that can process the expected flood of covid-19 vaccine injuries and side effects.
