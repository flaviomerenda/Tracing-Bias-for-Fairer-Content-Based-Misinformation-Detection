"It is the largest employment discrimination class action in history, and the court’s decision, expected by June, will probably be its most important business ruling this term.",no-bias
"The issue before the justices at Tuesday’s arguments was not whether Wal-Mart, the country’s largest retailer and biggest private employer, discriminated against women who worked there.",no-bias
"For now, the question in the case, Wal-Mart Stores v. Dukes, No. 10-277, is whether hundreds of thousands of female workers have enough in common to join together in a single lawsuit.",no-bias
"The plaintiffs’ theory is that a centralized companywide policy gave local managers too much discretion in pay and promotion decisions, leaving Wal-Mart vulnerable to gender stereotypes.",no-bias
The plaintiffs have presented sworn statements and statistics to support their claim.,no-bias
Wal-Mart calls that evidence unrepresentative and unreliable.,contains-bias
The company says its policies expressly bar discrimination and promote diversity.,no-bias
"In any event, the company says, the plaintiffs — who worked in 3,400 stores in 170 job classifications — do not have enough in common to warrant class-action treatment.",no-bias
Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the theory about how the company discriminated — through a central policy conferring local discretion — was internally inconsistent.,no-bias
"“Your complaint faces in two directions,” he told a lawyer for the plaintiffs.",no-bias
But Justice Stephen G. Breyer said Wal-Mart could be held accountable if it failed to take action in the face of reports of discrimination from its stores.,no-bias
“Should central management under the law have withdrawn some of the subjective discretion in order to stop these results?” Justice Breyer asked.,no-bias
"Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg agreed, saying that companies had a responsibility to make sure that women were treated fairly in local workplaces.",no-bias
And Justice Elena Kagan said that “excessive subjectivity” may be a policy that violates the civil rights laws.,no-bias
But Justice Antonin Scalia was unconvinced.,no-bias
"“I’m getting whipsawed here,” he told the plaintiffs’ lawyer, Joseph M. Sellers.",no-bias
"“On the one hand, you say the problem is that they were utterly subjective, and on the other hand you say there is strong corporate culture that guides all of this. Well, which is it?”",no-bias
"Mr. Sellers responded that “there is this broad discretion given the managers” but that “they do not make their decisions in a vacuum.” Managers, he went on, “are informed by the company about how to exercise that discretion.”",no-bias
That did not satisfy Justice Scalia.,no-bias
"“If somebody tells you how to exercise discretion,” he said, “you don’t have discretion.”",no-bias
"Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a lawyer for Wal-Mart, said the handful of women named as plaintiffs who seek to represent the entire class did not have typical experiences at the company.",no-bias
"“Each of the plaintiffs have very different stories,” he said.",no-bias
“One of them was promoted into a managerial position. One was terminated for disciplinary violations. One was promoted and then had a disciplinary problem and then was demoted.”,contains-bias
He added that “this class includes at least 544 store managers who are alleged to be discriminators and victims.”,no-bias
Several justices had practical concerns.,no-bias
"“What seems to me a very serious problem in this case is, how do you work out the back pay?” Justice Ginsburg asked.",no-bias
"Mr. Sellers said the trial court could rely on statistics culled from company databases, which he said were more reliable than the evidence that might be presented in individualized hearings given the available information about particular pay and promotion decisions.",no-bias
"Memories have faded, he said, and Wal-Mart did not keep good records.",no-bias
"Given that, Mr. Sellers said, Wal-Mart’s personnel decisions were “standardless” and “recordless.”",contains-bias
Justice Kennedy responded with a point about the suitability of the case for class-action treatment.,no-bias
"“If it’s standardless and recordless,” he said, “then why is there commonality?”",no-bias
Mr. Boutrous said Mr. Sellers was trying to have it both ways.,no-bias
"“The problem here, Mr. Sellers says, is that the records are not available,” Mr. Boutrous said.",no-bias
"“Then he says we’re going to have a proceeding where the district judge relies only on the records that he says are inadequate, to allow a reconstruction of the decision.",no-bias
That is not a process known to our jurisprudence.,no-bias
It doesn’t comport with due process.,no-bias
Several justices voiced concerns about how many companies could be subject to class-action suits if they allowed the case against Wal-Mart to go forward.,no-bias
"“Is it true,” Chief Justice Roberts asked Mr. Sellers, “that Wal-Mart’s pay disparity across the company was less than the national average?”",no-bias
"Mr. Sellers said that was not the appropriate comparison. “The comparison that’s relevant,” he said, “is between men and women and Wal-Mart.”",no-bias
He added later that “Wal-Mart was behind the other large retailers.”,no-bias
The chief justice also asked Mr. Sellers “how many examples of abuse of the subjective discrimination delegation need to be shown before you can say that flows from the policy rather than from bad actors?”,no-bias
"After all, he said, “you’re going to have some bad apples” given Wal-Mart’s thousands of stores.",no-bias
Mr. Sellers responded that “there is no minimum number” in court decisions.,no-bias
Justices Kennedy and Samuel A. Alito Jr. said they were concerned about companies whose pay and promotion gaps mirror national numbers where there is no proof of a discriminatory policy.,no-bias
"“So, you have the company that is absolutely typical of the entire American work force,” Justice Alito said.",no-bias
“Then you would say every single company is in violation of Title VII” of the Civil Rights Act?,no-bias
"“That could very well be the case,” Mr. Sellers said.",no-bias
Former Mexican President Vincente Fox made it loud and clear that he won’t be chipping in for any part of Donald Trump’s proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.,no-bias
"""I’m not going to pay for that f***ing wall!” Fox told Jorge Ramos in an interview for Fusion.",no-bias
“He should pay for it. He’s got the money.”,no-bias

"The former Mexican president, who led the country from 2000 to 2006, also questioned Trump’s allegiance to the Republican party, or, for that matter, any political party.",no-bias
"""He’s not a Republican. Absolutely not,” Fox said.",no-bias
"“Those are not Republican principles. He is not a Democrat. He is just himself. He is egocentric.""",contains-bias
"The comments from Fox echo those of his successor, Felipe Calderón, who a week ago asserted that Mexico will not pay for a border wall.",no-bias
"“Mexican people, we are not going to pay a single cent for such a stupid wall!",contains-bias
"And it's going to be completely useless,” Calderón told CNBC.",contains-bias
"For months, Trump has stood by his initial comments about building a border wall and getting Mexico to pay for it.",no-bias
"The morning after Calderón made the comments, the GOP front-runner appeared on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""",no-bias
"“I heard the head of Mexico said ‘no way,’ and I said, ‘Now the wall just got taller,” Trump said.",no-bias
Fox’s interview on Fusion comes about 6 months after Ramos had his own very public skirmish with Trump in which the Spanish-language news icon confronted the billionaire during a press conference in Iowa – prompting the candidate's security team to remove Ramos from the room.,no-bias
Ramos later returned and Trump took several of his questions.,no-bias
"“He tried to silence me,” the Mexican-born journalist told Fox News’ Megyn Kelly in August.",no-bias
"“And in this country, you cannot do that.",no-bias

"WASHINGTON –- The White House on Wednesday released the full set of emails surrounding the Obama administration’s development of talking points describing the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, in response to continuing charges from congressional Republicans that there was a massive political “cover-up” of what transpired there.",contains-bias
Nothing in the emails supports theories that the talking points were changed in order to influence the 2012 election.,contains-bias
"In a briefing with reporters at the White House on Wednesday afternoon, senior administration officials used the 100 pages of emails to show that a number of government agencies, not just the State Department, drove many of the changes to the talking points that were ultimately used by U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice.",no-bias
"The cache of emails paint a fuller picture than did an email leaked earlier this week, which portrayed a State Department concerned about its public image.",no-bias
Republican lawmakers have argued that the State Department and the White House were attempting to alter the talking points for political reasons and ignored suggestions and language put forward by the CIA.,contains-bias
"In particular, they pointed to the fact that references to al Qaeda and previous security warnings were removed.",no-bias
But senior administration officials stressed on Wednesday that such language in fact was taken out at the request of the CIA.,no-bias
Critics have said the role of State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland in revising the talking points in particular shows an administration trying to protect its reputation as being tough on terrorism.,contains-bias
"They have criticized Nuland for requesting to remove a line from the final draft noting that there had been ""at least five other attacks against foreign interests in Benghazi by unidentified assailants.""",no-bias

"But senior administration officials on Wednesday said that Michael J. Morell, then the deputy director of the CIA, also wanted that line removed, separately from Nuland.",no-bias
Morell believed it was irrelevant to the message of the talking points -- what happened in Benghazi -- and unprofessional to include those warnings but not allow State Department officials to include how they had responded to them.,contains-bias
"Separate from Wednesday's document release, the CIA recently conducted an internal review of how and why the talking points were changed -- a move that also came in response to the continuing questions from Congress.",no-bias

"A U.S. intelligence official told The Huffington Post the review was completed ""early this year.""",no-bias
"Senior administration officials, discussing that internal review, relayed that some CIA officials didn't like that the original draft of the talking points said the government ""know[s] that Islamic extremists with ties to al-Qa'ida participated in the attack,"" because at that time it was premature to name those responsible for the attacks.",no-bias
Their concerns at other times were more mundane.,no-bias
"For example, CIA officials also decided to change the phrase ""attacks in Benghazi ... evolved into a direct assault against the US Consulate"" to ""demonstrations in Benghazi"" because they believed ""attacks"" and ""assault"" were synonymous, making the phrase illogical.",no-bias

"In a response shortly after the emails were made public on Wednesday, Brendan Buck, spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), said just that.",no-bias
"""The House interim report found that 'senior State Department officials requested the talking points be changed to avoid criticism for ignoring the threat environment in Benghazi' and that those changes were ultimately made,"" said Buck.",no-bias
"""Those findings are confirmed by the emails released today, and they contradict statements made by the White House that it and the State Department only changed one word in the talking points.",no-bias
