"A reporter for The Washington Post, David Fahrenthold, has uncovered another instance where GOP nominee Donald Trump has made some questionable tax-related choices. The investigation that Faherenthold launched into the Trump Foundation, along with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s personal finances, has unearthed the fact that Donald Trump has used his charitable foundation, which is tax-exempt, as a tool to evade $2.3 million dollars of personal income taxes. How? By having business associates that owe him money to put it into his foundation instead. An excellent example is that the Trump Foundation took in payments “totaling nearly $1.9 million from a man in New York City who sells sought-after tickets and one-of-a-kind experiences to wealthy clients.” According to sources in the Trump organization who wish to remain anonymous the man is Richard Ebers, and he was told that instead of paying the former reality TV star for services, he should pay the Trump Foundation instead. It makes sense really, when you consider the fact that despite the reality that Donald Trump hasn’t even bothered donating to his own foundation since 2008 the “donations” continue to pour in. One of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s senior advisers, Boris Epshteyn, actually tried to explain it away by saying: ‘What Trump did was provide a service, renounce any fees, and then merely “suggest” that the other party make a donation to a charity of their choosing.’ The irony is not lost on anyone that he’s basically saying it’s legal, and it is, despite the fact that anyone with half a mind deduce the shady implications. Marc Owens, Head of the Internal Revenue Service’s non-profit watchdog agency, hasn’t been very thorough in his monitoring of the Trump foundation and seems shocked by all of the information that Fahrenthold’s investigation has managed to uncover. Owens, said: ‘This is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen this, and I’ve been doing this for 25 years in the IRS, and 40 years total.’ It’s pretty obvious to anyone that’s paying attention that the GOP nominee is probably violating the rules that were written to prevent this kind of blatant laundering of money when it comes to tax-exempt foundations. If Donald Trump were to be charged and found guilty of violating these laws the punishment would mean a monetary penalty, losing the tax-exempt status for his foundation, and even, perhaps, criminal charges being filed. When asked by journalist Sharyl Attkisson: ‘Are you confident that the Trump Foundation has followed all charitable rules and laws?’ Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump responded: ‘Well, I hope so… I mean, my lawyers do it.’ It’s kind of ironic that the Trump campaign would go after the Clinton Foundation when Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s own Trump Foundation has such shady things going on. For shady example, his foundation has zero paid staff. The Trump Foundation has literally been laundering money under the guise of being a “charity” and the person profiting from it all is none-other-than Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.

"A Kansas sheriffs deputy was murdered on Sunday by illegal immigrants that had been arrested on two occasions already. The perpetrator was Adrian Espinosa-Flores who is 38 years old. He was charged on Monday with the crime of involuntary manslaughter. Allegedly, he was driving drunk and crashed his truck into a patrol car that had been stopped on the side of the road. Unfortunately the crash led to the death of Johnson County Sheriff’s Department Master Deputy Brandon Collins who was 45 years of age at the time of the accident. The Kansas City Star reported in the investigation. They reported that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement had made an immigration detainer on the suspect Espinosa-Flores. Detainers are requests that people be transferred into the custody of ICE. They are specifically made for the purposes of immigration violations. An anonymous source with inside knowledge of the investigation tipped off the media that the detainer the suspect had was because of allegations he was in the country illegally. The Johnson County District Attorney’s Office refused to answer any questions saying that it is an ongoing investigation. The suspect was arrested for DUI in 2001 and in 2013 had a traffic violation however ICE noted they had not been notified of these previous arrests. 41 Action News reported, “it could be considered profiling because a lot of people of all races are arrested without a proper ID.” People laughed Donald Trump off and called him a xenophobe when he pointed out all the people in the United States murdered by illegal immigrants. Surely, they’re not laughing now. This very sad and tragic incident proves that Trump’s comments about violent illegal immigrants is far truer than anyone would like to admit. However, come November when he builds that wall this hopefully won’t be as great of an issue anymore.   ",true
"A member of Donald Trumpâs presidential campaign has creepy words about what could happen if her candidate becomes president of the United States. As part of a PBS special on the candidates, former contestant and current Trump 2016 director of African-American outreach Omarasa Manigault said the key to the campaign was Trumpâs desire to see his political enemies on their knees:  Omarosa Manigault, a contestant on âThe Apprenticeâ who is director of African-American outreach for Trumpâs campaign, explains what she sees as Trumpâs motivations for running for president. Among them: resentments. âEvery critic, every detractor, will have to bow down to President Trump,â she says. âItâs everyone whoâs ever doubted Donald, whoever disagreed, whoever challenged him â it is the ultimate revenge to become the most powerful man in the universe.â In the video accompanying Manigaultâs comments, the night of the 2011 White House Correspondentâs Association dinner is revisited, in which President Obama infamously roasted Donald Trump, who was in attendance. The President, riffing on Trumpâs promotion of the birther conspiracy theory, came at the reality TV star with his comedy guns blazing. Obama heaped joke after joke on Trump during the roast, and reports have indicated that Trump was seething but sitting stone-faced during the monologue. Some now believe that the episode embarrassed Trump so completely that he decided then to run for president as revenge for the humiliation. Regardless of whether that is true or not, history will record that as Obama was crushing Trumpâs spirit, he had already given the green light to the Navyâs infamous Seal Team Six to go into Pakistan and capture or execute al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. As the Correspondentâs Association audience laughed at Obama making fun of Trump, members of the U.S. Navy were in the process of killing one of the most wanted men in world history. And Obama never broke a sweat. ",true
"Sometimes when you try to be clever, it backfires… it’s always a gamble.

"Target garnered intense criticism for a Christmas sweater that seemingly mocked people who suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder. The store received backlash from customers who felt the sweater, which had the phrase “Obsessive Christmas Disorder” written on the front, belittled and mocked a serious mental disorder.  “As someone with OCD I’d really appreciate it if you didn’t sell my illness as a fashion statement,” Twitter user Reign Murphy tweeted alongside a photo of her holding up the sweater.   Others reacted similarly to the controversy, with several blasting the retail giant for mocking a “serious mental illness.” ""Today at Target I saw a sweater that said 'OCD Obsessive Christmas Disorder'…why is trivializing a mental disorder so widely accepted?” one tweet about the sweater read. Target ultimately responded to the backlash with an apology, but stopped short of removing the item from its stores. “We never want to disappoint our guests and we apologize for any discomfort. We currently do not have plans to remove this sweater,” spokesman Josh Thomas said in the statement.  Target was previously the center of similar controversy regarding a sign that referenced “building sets” and “girls’ building sets” for sale. It was also criticized for selling a women's T-shirt with the word “Trophy” on the front, which inspired a successful petition for its removal. “The truth is that millions of women and young girls are taken as ‘trophies’ every year in war, sex trafficking, slavery, and rape,” the petition said, Fortune reported. “Labeling any person as a ‘Trophy’ is demeaning their humanity and objectifying them as a tangible object that can be bought, used, and disposed of.” Target responded to that controversy by apologizing for offending customers. “It is never our intention to offend anyone,” the company’s statement read. “These shirts are intended as a fun wink and we have received an overwhelmingly positive response from our guests.” Sources: USA Today, Fortune / Photo credit: Reign Murphy/Twitter via Spectacular Photo Wonders ",true
"""For 30 years you’ve been doing it, and now you just started thinking of solutions.” — Donald Trump Trump has said at least three times that Hillary Clinton has been working on trade issues, and other national policy issues, for 30 years. But as Clinton said, it hasn’t been “quite that long.” In 1986, Clinton was Arkansas first lady, and her involvement on trade policy would have been limited at best. Her first major role in national politics was as First Lady, when former President Bill Clinton won his first presidential race in 1992.",true
"President Barack Obama mourned the death of golf legend Arnold Palmer in a statement released Monday, celebrating him as “the American dream come to life.” Palmer, widely regarded as one of golf’s greatest stars, died Sunday in Pittsburgh at the age of 87. He won seven major tournaments over the course of his career, including four Masters Tournaments, and 65 wins on the PGA Tour rank him 5th all-time on that list. He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2004 by President George W. Bush and the Congressional Gold Medal in 2009. Story Continued Below “With his homemade swing and homespun charm, Arnold Palmer had swagger before we had a name for it,” the president said in a statement released by the White House. “From a humble start working at the local club in his beloved Latrobe, Pennsylvania, to superstardom as the face of golf around the globe, Arnold was the American Dream come to life.” ""Along the way he racked up win after win – but it wasn’t his success that made him King. Arnold’s freewheeling, fearless approach to the game inspired a generation of golfers and, for the first time on TV, enthralled an audience across the world. Sure, we liked that he won seven majors, but we loved that he went for it when he probably should have laid up,” Obama, himself an avid golfer, continued. “That spirit extended beyond the links where he gave freely of himself and poured everything he had into everything he did: from building hospitals to personally responding to countless letters from his fans. And he did it all with a grin that hinted maybe he had one more shot up his sleeve.""",true
"If you want to watch a conservative throw a temper tantrum just mention slavery and grab your popcorn. Because when First Lady Michelle Obama talked about slavery and the great progress our country has made since the Civil War during an interview at the new Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture, conservatives took to Twitter to whine. Mrs. Obama told host Robin Roberts about how she feels about visiting the museum, which opens this weekend. And one of the things that struck her the most is the fact that a lot of the history the museum presents happened during the lives of the three generations of her family who visited the museum that day. And she expressed astonishment at how fast progress has been made. “When you think about the fact that my great-great grandfather was a slave and today I live in the White House, that progress is huge and it’s fast,” the First Lady said.

The two parties have flipped since then. Democrats have since become the defenders of Civil Rights who continue to fight for racial equality and social justice while Republicans pandered to white racists in the South and have become dominated by white supremacists who desperately want to roll back any and all progress African-Americans have made in this country. If Republicans have to go back 150 years to find one good thing the party did for African-Americans that’s really embarrassing and says a lot about what the party has become. ",true

"The first major polls of last night’s debate are out and show a resounding victory for Hillary Clinton across the board, whose poise, demeanor, and experience shown through in contrast to Donald Trump, who was repeatedly obnoxious and vapid in his babbling responses.  VOX rounded them up, and here’s the results: A poll of debate watchers by CNN/ORC, which found that 62 percent thought Clinton won and 27 percent thought Trump did. CNN’s David Chalian emphasized on air that the sample was 10 points more Democratic than in a typical poll, but that’s still a strong win for Clinton. A poll of debate watchers by Public Policy Polling, which found that 51 percent thought Clinton won and 40 percent thought Trump won. A focus group of 20 undecided Florida voters by CNN found that 18 of them thought Clinton won. And a focus group of Pennsylvania voters by GOP pollster Frank Luntz overwhelmingly thought Clinton had won. Libby Nelson has more details about that here. That tremendous advantage for Clinton is crucial, given that some 50% of likely voters have said that the debates will help inform their decision.

"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump quickly laid into each other over trade during the first presidential debate, with Clinton citing her husband’s work on NAFTA as evidence she’s thought a lot about trade deals and Trump calling NAFTA the worst deal “ever approved” in the U.S. “I think my husband did a pretty good job [on trade deals] in the 1990s.

"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama ignored his own ""no hats"" edict Monday when he partook in a traditional American Indian ceremony in Washington. Appearing at the White House's Tribal Nations conference, Obama was wrapped in a wool blanket and crowned with a straw hat as a show of honor. Brian Cladoosby, president of the National Congress of American Indians, said the blanket was called ""Rhythm of the Land."" He said there was a blanket set aside for first lady Michelle Obama as well. As members from different tribes played drums and shakers, Obama smiled and faced an audience comprised of representatives from the 567 federally recognized tribes that were invited to attend. He removed the hat after 20 seconds or so as the ceremony proceeded. ""What an amazing honor and what a kind gesture for the honor song and the blanket and the hat,"" Obama said afterward, calling the event ""very moving"" and a reflection of the friendships he's developed among tribal communities. An embroidered inscription on the blanket gave Obama's Crow namesake, ""Black Eagle,"" and a description: ""Awe Kooda Bilaxpak Kuxshish,"" or ""One Who Helps People Throughout the Land."" A label identified the blanket as a product of the Pendleton Woolen Mills line. ""I have to say that I am very glad that you also have a blanket for Michelle so she doesn't steal mine,"" he said. ""She would, too!"" Obama used his remarks to highlight his efforts toward improving conditions on reservations, including bolstering schools and advancing medical care. The President has typically been wary of donning any headwear besides a baseball cap -- a political lesson he imparted during an appearance at the White House in 2013. ""Here's the general rule: You don't put stuff on your head if you're president. That's politics 101,"" he said when presented with a football helmet from the US Naval Academy.

"As police today captured the man wanted for questioning in connection to a series of explosive devices in New York City and New Jersey, new information about him has begun to emerge. The man, Ahmad Khan Rahami, 28, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. He was discovered and captured in Linden, New Jersey, not far from his last known address in Elizabeth.       A U.S. official initially told ABC News Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000, but his father later said the family came over in 1995. Court records indicate Ahmad Rahami was from a large family and may have as many as seven siblings. Former classmates said he attended Edison High School in New Jersey. One of them, Chris Konya, said Rahami was quiet but funny and a ""pretty normal guy."" Konya and another former classmate said Rahami had a child with his high school girlfriend. Rahami was enrolled at Middlesex County College from fall of 2010 to fall of 2012, where he worked toward an associate's degree in criminal justice but did not graduate, according to school officials.   The Rahami family owned a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth. An employee and a recent customer said Rahami worked there. ""I come in here every week or two, just to get something to eat,"" local resident Ryan McCann told The Associated Press. ""He's always in there. He's a very friendly guy. That's what's so scary. It's hard when it's home."" Members of the Rahami family apparently did not get along well with the local police and sued several officers in 2011 for allegedly harassing them over purported violations related the restaurant's operation. The case was dismissed in 2012, pending the resolution of a related legal matter, according to documents. Investigators are poring over Rahami's past travel, including what may have been a recent nearly year-long trip in which he flew to Quetta, Pakistan in April 2013 and returned to the U.S. through the United Arab Emirates in March 2014, according to the U.S. official. Rahami reported to authorities that he was visiting his wife and family, who he said were Afghan refugees living in Quetta, and that he had traveled by car between Pakistan and Afghanistan.   In August 2014 Rahami was arrested after allegedly stabbing someone in the leg, according to court documents. A complaint filed by a police officer said the officer ""has reason to believe that the person is a danger to himself, others or property,"" but Rahami was not indicted. Today Rahami was shot at least once by police during an exchange of gunfire before he was captured and then taken to a local hospital, authorities said. He is not cooperating with investigators, even so far as refusing to give his name, according to a source briefed on the case. Officials said they have not determined a motive for the attacks. Late Monday officials announced charges against Rahami related to the shootout with police: five counts of attempted murder, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose. Bail has been set at $5.2 million. It is unclear if Rahami has an attorney. A senior Afghan official told ABC News the Afghan government is ready to assist the U.S. in any way it can and is searching for any information it may have on Rahami.   ABC News' Cindy Galli, Megan Christie, Randy Kreider, Alex Hosenball and Cho Park contributed to this report. [Editor's Note Sept. 28, 2016: The original version of this report said that Ahmad Rahami came to the U.S. in 2000. Rahami's father later told ABC News, however, that his son and the family came in 1995 and that Rahami received his Green Card in 2000.]",true

"Politico POLITICO's must-read briefing on what's driving the day in Washington Good morning from Hempstead, New York. The general consensus is this: Donald Trump didn’t throw up on his shoes. But Hillary Clinton had the far better night in their first 90-minute (it actually lasted 95 minutes) matchup here at Hofstra University on Long Island. Clinton mostly kept her cool -- as did Trump for the first portion of the evening. Trump ended up citing Sid Blumenthal, Rosie O’Donnell and referring viewers to Sean Hannity to vouch for his opposition to the Iraq War. The pre-debate buzz among reporters here was that Trump left himself the option to come to the spin room, but would only show up if he needed to change the narrative. He came to the spin room, and then spoke to Hannity live from the press filing center. Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) pointed out that “she can’t remember last time, if ever, a general election candidate went to the spin room.” Not a good sign for Trump. LAST NIGHT Hillary Clinton ended the debate by saying, “And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest. He loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them. And he called this woman Ms. Piggy. Then he called her Ms. Housekeeping, because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name...Her name is Alicia Machado and she has become a U.S. citizen, and you can bet she's going to vote this November.""

The early take is that Trump was stable for the first 30 minutes, which gives Republicans hope that any negative impact will be limited. 42 DAYS until Election Day. The government shuts down Friday. THE NARRATIVE -- “Clinton set the trap and Trump walked in: The Democrat dominated the debate. Will it matter?” by Eli Stokols: “‘Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that’s all to his benefit,’ Clinton started. ‘He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there.’ Trump quickly dismissed Clinton’s characterization, saying he received ‘a very small loan’ that he turned into a company valued, he claimed, in the billions. ‘I say that only because that’s the kind of thinking that our country needs.’ In the moment, he seemed calm—but from that point forward he was anything but. ‘She mind-screwed him from the beginning by mentioning the loan from his father,’ said Rob Stutzman, a GOP operative in California. ‘That was brilliant psychological warfare on her part. He slowly unwound from there, culminating in borderline incoherency over the final 30 minutes.’” http://politi.co/2cynqH0 JMART and PAT HEALY on A1 of the NYT, “CANDIDATES PRESS POINTED ATTACKS IN ACERBIC DEBATE -- Trump Raps Clinton on Trade and Email -- She Counters on His Fitness”: “In a relentlessly antagonistic debate, Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton clashed over trade, the Iraq war, his refusal to release his tax returns and her use of a private email server, with Mr. Trump frequently showing impatience and political inexperience as Mrs. Clinton pushed him to defend his past denigration of women and President Obama. Mr. Trump repeatedly interrupted Mrs. Clinton and at times talked over her throughout the 90-minute debate, making slashing attacks that surely pleased his Republican base but may have been off-putting to women and undecided voters. He also left unchallenged her assertion that he paid no federal taxes for years.” http://nyti.ms/2cyicen … A1 PDF http://nyti.ms/2cZMY2O --WaPo leadall by Phil Rucker and Anne Gearan: “Donald Trump unrelentingly blamed the nation’s chronic problems on ‘typical politician’ Hillary Clinton, yet he found himself mostly on the defensive in their first debate here Monday night as she denounced him for racial insensitivity, hiding potential conflicts of interest and ‘stiffing’ those who helped build his business empire … Trump … spent much of the evening explaining himself — over his temperament, treatment of women and minorities, business practices and readiness to be commander in chief, as well as over his long perpetuation of a falsehood about Barack Obama’s birthplace to delegitimize his presidency. ‘He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior, and the birther lie was a very hurtful one,’ said Clinton ... ‘Barack Obama is a man of great dignity, and I could tell how much it bothered him and annoyed him that this was being touted and used against him.’ Trump, who earlier this month at last acknowledged Obama’s birth in Hawaii, replied by invoking Clinton’s 2008 rivalry with Obama: ‘When you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn’t work.’” http://wapo.st/2dokMt5 FOR REFERENCE -- The full transcript http://politi.co/2doh9Dw GOTHAM WATCH -- N.Y.

Trump is supposed to be the big meanie but it was Clinton who hit him where it hurt most … What about the Clinton Foundation? The former secretary's debate team … expected him to savage her on the various questions raised about her family's foundation. They were worried about it. While he hammered her ever-so-briefly on emails, he was so engaged in self-justification, he flat-out forgot to pursue an attack that could have made the night a lot less lousy. His ‘30 years’ attack worked - and he’ll use it again … [T]here were a few gold nuggets strewn in the wreckage of Hofstra - the most valuable an assault (demonstrable and fact-checker-friendly) on Clinton’s effectiveness in 25-plus years of public life … “Clinton effectively attacked his business career … Clinton plucked the strains of what could be a genuine crossover hit this fall among ever-elusive white working-class voters and independents: Trump’s failure to turn over his tax returns. Clinton went there with a vengeance – engaging in a little Trump-esque fact-free speculation about the motives of the billionaire developer-turned-reality TV star … Her most effective attack - and his worst answer. If the GOP nominee needed any more proof that preparation trumps bombast in a general election debate, he got it when Clinton launched a merciless attack on his habit of stiffing contractors who have labored on his construction projects over the years.” http://politi.co/2czumZu --@realDonaldTrump: “Nothing on emails.

Clinton also was seen as having done a better job addressing concerns voters might have about her potential presidency by a 57% to 35% margin, and as the stronger leader by a 56% to 39% margin. The gap was smaller on which candidate appeared more sincere and authentic, though still broke in Clinton's favor, with 53% saying she was more sincere vs. 40% who felt Trump did better on that score.

She knew when to attack and when to explain – and how to pace it all over 90 minutes. Donald Trump started off great for the first few questions. He had an effective refrain of slamming Clinton’s ‘30 years’ of nothing, which resonated particularly well with independent voters. For the first 15-20 minutes, Trump’s numbers consistently went up whenever he railed against the current system and all its problems. Trump talked a lot about problems. But Clinton talked about solutions. ... “At the end of the night, Clinton moved the dials more with my group – 16 voters declared her the debate winner, while five said Trump won. Focus group consisted of 27 participants, all undecided voters from Pennsylvania. Pre-Debate: 10 leaned toward Clinton, six leaned toward Trump, and 11 were neutral.

And for most of the first presidential debate, he stayed there, letting the battleships of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump shoot their missiles at one another. It made for some memorable exchanges between Trump and Clinton, matched in close-up on most networks. For some debate watchers, that’s what they want their moderators to do: say ‘go’ and let them run. But it also left some gaps where viewers probably expected sharp questions. “There was no probing of Trump’s wall with Mexico, and vow to get the Mexicans to pay for it, or the Republican nominee’s ban on Muslims entering the country. And he barely prodded Clinton to explain her private email server in a question so gently worded that she was able to dispatch the issue with a few taut sentences.The Clinton Foundation? Wasn’t discussed; neither was the Benghazi attack. Few moderators have faced such intense scrutiny in the days leading up to the debate as Holt did, with Clinton’s allies demanding he serve as a fact-checker and Trump’s backers insisting that he allow the candidates to have their say.” http://politi.co/2dyVlEm -- “Donald Trump Says Lester Holt Did ‘Great Job,’ but Some Surrogates Disagree,” by WSJ’s Reid Epstein in Hempstead: “‘There were a few issues I felt like he should have raised, like the Clinton Foundation, that were not raised,’ Alabama Sen.

Peter] King said. ‘If he was going to ask Donald Trump about his taxes he certainly could have asked Hillary Clinton about all the money she got from Wall Street and refuses to disclose the speeches that she made.

[T]he biggest factor driving Conway’s outsize public reputation is her omnipresence on television. She spends far more time in front of the cameras than typical campaign managers do, appearing constantly on cable news, network morning shows, and even Bill Maher’s HBO talk show Real Time … Some have questioned whether it’s possible for her to effectively manage a national presidential campaign from a green room.” http://bzfd.it/2cZOsdn **** A message from BP: We’ve donated $147 million to U.S. community programs over the past five years.

Hillary, on the other hand, was passionate and forceful in her support of stronger gun laws that save lives.” The statement comes as they are launching a 14-state “Vocal Majority Tour” to try and make the 2016 election a referendum on gun safety.

The technology is called VTOL — which stands for vertical takeoff and landing. Simply put, VTOL is an aircraft that can hover, take off and land vertically, which would also describe a helicopter.

"Newark (CNN)Former Port Authority executives and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie staffers planned to make the traffic from the September 2013 lane closures at the George Washington Bridge ""as bad as possible,"" according to testimony heard in federal court Monday. David Wildstein, former Port Authority director of Interstate Capital Projects, testified that in June 2013, Bridget Kelly, Christie's former deputy chief of staff, was upset that their office had not secured the endorsement of the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee New Jersey, Mark Sokolich, for Christie's reelection campaign. Wildstein, who has previously pleaded guilty to one charge of conspiracy to commit fraud on federally funded property and one civil rights violation, told Kelly that shutting down access lanes to the George Washington Bridge to put some political pressure on Sokolich was an option, according to his testimony. Wildstein is testifying as part of his plea deal. Sokolich testified last week that being a ""Democrat in a Democratic town"" put him in an uncomfortable position vis-a-vis a Christie endorsement, and he eventually declined because he did not want to ""alienate anyone."" On August 13, 2013, and as CNN has previously reported, Wildstein received an email from Kelly saying: ""Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee."" ""Got it,"" Wildstein responded. A phone call with Kelly the same day established the lane closures would go forward, it was revealed in testimony Monday. ""I did not question senior officials in the office of the governor,"" Wildstein said in court when asked if he questioned the decision. Wildstein became the de facto organizer of the eventual lane closures, and communicated every step of the way with Kelly and his then-boss, former Port Authority deputy executive director, Bill Baroni, according to his testimony. Wildstein and Kelly discussed and agreed that there would be no advance notice of the closures to Fort Lee officials or the public. They discussed how the Port Authority would respond to any inquiries, and agreed that all calls would be directed to Baroni's office and Baroni would not return the calls, testimony revealed. This ""radio silence"" policy was discussed with and approved by Baroni, Wildstein said. Wildstein testified that that lack of advance notice was to ""maximize the impact on Fort Lee."" Wildstein also recalled discussing the timing of the closures with Baroni and Kelly. Baroni asked when the first day of school in Fort Lee was, and when Wildstein told Baroni it was September 9, Baroni smiled and said, ""Fantastic,"" according to Wildstein's testimony. Kelly agreed on the September 9 date. Wildstein testified that his initial plan was to shut down all three Fort Lee access lanes, but after discussing the matter with Port Authority engineers who feared this could cause ""sideswipe crashes,"" Wildstein recommended to Baroni and Kelly that they shut down two lanes. On Friday, September 6, 2013, Wildstein informed several Port Authority staffers of the closures that were scheduled to begin on Monday, September 9. Bob Durando, Port Authority general manager of the George Washington Bridge expressed concern, telling Wildstein that the closures would cause a ""mess."" Wildstein told Durando the closures would be going forward, and to prepare accordingly. ""I told him not to say anything to anybody,"" Wildstein testified. Wildstein told Durando to direct any inquiries he gets during the closures to Baroni's office. Wildstein then informed former Port Authority chief engineer, Peter Zipf, of the closures, and asked Zipf to organize a way to get ""some numbers"" on the traffic patterns. Wildstein also informed Cedrick Fulton, Port Authority director of Tunnels, Bridges and Terminals. Fulton asked if Port Authority executive director, Patrick Foye, was aware. Wildstein testified that he told Fulton ""yes,"" but that this was a lie. All of these staffers were under the impression that the closures were part of a traffic study. On the day the closures began, Wildstein watched the traffic build up on screens inside a Port Authority administration building on the Fort Lee side of the George Washington Bridge. ""I knew the plan that I had set into motion was working,"" Wildstein testified. A Port Authority lieutenant also drove Wildstein around Fort Lee so Wildstein could see the traffic on the ground. Wildstein testified that he called Kelly that morning to tell her that traffic was building up, and ""she was pleased."" Several calls and emails began coming in to Baroni and Wildstein from Fort Lee officials, including the mayor, Sokolich, but their plan of ""radio silence"" was put into effect and no messages were returned. Last week, Wildstein testified that Baroni's role at the bi-state agency was essentially to be a representative of Christie's administration and that their top priority was to represent Christie's office's interests. Wildstein said he created a phrase that he and Baroni often used, ""the one constituent rule."" This referred to the fact that Governor Christie's opinion or good favor was the only one that mattered when it came to Port Authority affairs. Wildstein and Baroni used the ""one constituent rule"" as a barometer by which decisions would be made. Kelly and Baroni face conspiracy and fraud charges in connection with Bridgegate. Their attorneys have previously said they will both testify in their own defenses. ",true
"According to Homeland Security’s Inspector General, at least 858 immigrants from foreign countries that pose national security risks, as well as those from countries with high immigration fraud who had orders to have them deported were “mistakenly” granted citizenship. An internal Homeland Security audit was released Monday, which documented the “mistake.” The Associated Press reports: The report does not identify any of the immigrants by name, but Inspector General John Roth’s auditors said they were all from “special interest countries” — those that present a national security concern for the United States — or neighboring countries with high rates of immigration fraud. The report did not identify those countries. DHS said the findings reflect what has long been a problem for immigration officials — old paper-based records containing fingerprint information that can’t be searched electronically. DHS says immigration officials are in the process of uploading these files and that officials will review “every file” identified as a case of possible fraud. The gap was created because older, paper records were never added to fingerprint databases created by both the now-defunct Immigration and Naturalization Service and the FBI in the 1990s. ICE, the DHS agency responsible for finding and deporting immigrants living in the country illegally, didn’t consistently add digital fingerprint records of immigrants whom agents encountered until 2010. And this is what happens when government puts its nose in things like healthcare and other unconstitutional things it usurps its authority to meddle in. If the central government had been focused only on the things it is authorized to deal with, this matter would more than likely never have occurred. Not only that, but you can rest assured that no one will be held accountable in the matter. While DHS is blaming paper issues and fingerprints, there were some of those who were awarded citizenship that were set to be deported. While Chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Michael McCaul called on ICE to have all immigration fingerprints digitized, but the threat to national security is great since citizens can apply and obtain security clearances or take jobs which are security sensitive. According to Roth, at least three of these new citizens acquired aviation or transportation worker credentials, granting them access to secure areas in airports or maritime facilities and vessels. He went on to state that their credentials were revoked once it was discovered that they had been given citizenship mistakenly. He also said that another individual had been given the role of a law enforcement officer. While changes were recommended and DHS agreed with them and said they would work to implement them, this problem has been going on for years. According to the AP report, “The government has known about the information gap and its impact on naturalization decisions since at least 2008 when a Customs and Border Protection official identified 206 immigrants who used a different name or other biographical information to gain citizenship or other immigration benefits, though few cases have been investigated.” What has really been done about it? Nothing. Are we really to expect something new?

"Tragedy has left the Miami Marlins team in devastation. Their friend, colleague and someone they probably considered family, has died in a tragic accident. Such unexpected shocking loss is not an experience to wish on anyone.  Jose Fernandez, their pitcher, was killed in a boating accident Sunday morning. It was just last week he had posted a picture on social media of his girlfriend who had an obvious ‘baby bump’ in an announcement that they were expecting their first child. In its caption, he told the world he thanked his girlfriend for coming into his life and expressed his excitement for their future together as a family. A news conference was held by his team after learning of his death and the team’s manager, Don Mattingly, was very visibly shaken during the conference, in tears over the loss of his team player and friend. “I see such a little boy,” Mattingly said. “The way he played, there was just joy with him when he played.” When the news conference was over, left fielder, Christian Yellich and the team’s second baseman, Dee Gordon, embraced and walked out somberly with other team members. A loss like this, so unexpected… was visibly painful watching them trying to get a grip on the situation. Earlier, Gordon had walked out to the mound at Marlins Park, where the grounds crew had painted a “16” — Fernandez’s number — and placed a Marlins cap. Gordon stood looking at the tribute before kneeling down in a moment of silent reflection. “Sadly, the brightest lights are often the ones that extinguish the fastest,” Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria said in a statement.  We are stunned and devastated by the tragic news that Jose Fernandez, 24, has died in a boating accident. https://t.co/QIBcnIYJ1i pic.twitter.com/SDZoL6NMEb — MLB (@MLB) September 25, 2016    I will miss you… Sorry if i never told you how valuable your friendship was too me… pic.twitter.com/HzstRZDBri — Tom Koehler (@TKREFRESH22) September 25, 2016    You loved striking me out, and teasing me about it.

"In front of the largest televised debate audience ever, Donald Trump blew it. Swing-state Republicans expressed frustration at his Monday night performance, characterizing it as a series of missed opportunities to move the dial in the places that will matter most to his electoral fortunes in November. Story Continued Below Name-checking battleground states like Michigan and Ohio was a wise move, state and local GOP leaders said. And Trump’s message on trade resonates in industrial areas across the Rust Belt, from Pennsylvania to Wisconsin. But above all else, Republican officials and operatives lamented his lack of preparation and failure to reach persuadable voters, especially women and GOP-leaners who are not yet sold on him. Instead of prosecuting the case against Hillary Clinton — which would have helped accelerate the consolidation of the GOP base in states like Pennsylvania where once-reticent Republicans are beginning to fall in line behind the nominee — Trump got bogged down defending controversial decisions he’s made, from championing birtherism to making insensitive comments about women. “I think Trump should have been better prepared,” said Alan Novak, a former Pennsylvania Republican Party chairman. “Her preparation, strategically, helped her control the flow of that debate. It was like a basketball game when the pace is dictated by one team. She clearly did that. His focus was on himself, explaining too much about him. The opportunity was missed to go after vulnerable points on her.” “He started out having a little bit of a better [performance] than what I was anticipating, on trade issues I believe he had her back on her heels in the very first part,” said a veteran North Carolina Republican strategist, working on several races in the state. “There were a lot of opportunities, when they got into discussing cybersecurity, to inject emails, the whole narrative of her carelessness, national security matters and all that. It was a missed opportunity by Trump that comes from a lack of being prepared.” In interviews with more than a dozen battleground state Republican leaders, there was widespread agreement that Trump’s core supporters would continue to stand by him, and that the election would remain close in their states — they characterized the debate as a failure to accomplish what he needed to, rather than a costly debacle. “Trump had the opportunity to raise questions about her emails, to raise questions about the Clinton Foundation, to raise questions about Benghazi, to raise questions about a host of other things, and he simply failed to do it,” said Charlie Gerow, a GOP strategist based in Pennsylvania. While Trump surrogates criticized moderator Lester Holt after the debate, “The burden was on him to do that,” said Gerow of Trump. The GOP nominee started the debate off strong, many Republicans agreed, initially pushing a message of change and a successful attack on trade policy. But he was repeatedly drawn into protracted fights that didn’t advance his interests, and his lack of policy command was apparent. Trump’s approach to national security and foreign policy was a particular sticking point with Bill Urbanski, a former GOP chair of northeastern Pennsylvania’s Luzerne County, who said he was bothered by Trump’s seemingly contradictory response to a question about whether the U.S. should embrace a no-first-use nuclear weapons policy. “Trump was just nowhere near actually being responsive to the question that was posed,” he said. “I guess it could mean two things: one could be…trying to dodge the question because he was trying to make a particular point, but the way I read that was, he didn’t have an answer to that question.” The end result: Republican-leaners like Urbanski still see no reason to rally to him, raising questions about whether Trump will be able to hit the level of party support achieved by Mitt Romney in Pennsylvania in 2012. “Man, it continues to trouble me,” said Urbanski, who said he would like to back Trump and can’t stomach voting for Clinton. “This guy is not qualified for this job. He presents himself that way every time I see him. I can’t get over that hurdle.” Added Gerow, “My sense is, no minds were changed last night among those who had cemented their views…but among the 8, 10, 12, 15 percent who are still genuinely persuadable, I think last night slowed down, if not halted, Trump’s momentum. That’s, I think, the problem. He’s got to try to regain momentum. He has to get back on offense.” While there are still two debates to go, there won’t be many better chances to win over undecided voters, convince fence-sitting Republicans or energize the base. In Ohio’s Warren County, party regulars were primed for the first showdown between Clinton and Trump, hoping to see him stick it to Clinton at a local GOP watch party. “We had folks from the statewide and national party, we had local party folks and then we had Trump campaigners, and we had citizens at large,” said Jeff Monroe, the Warren County GOP chairman. “They were totally into it and all jazzed up, more so than I anticipated. The energy level in the room was significantly better than I anticipated.” But when asked for Trump’s strongest moments in the debate, Monroe explained his impression this way. “It’s more along the lines that there wasn’t anything catastrophic that would change the outcome,” he said. “I think that what we saw was that he was doing his very best to distinguish himself from both political sets. He was taking that approach,” Monroe said. “I think that’s going to play well with a lot of the folks that are supporting him. Regardless of whether or not, as the pundits have pointed out, there was some slippage later on, he distinguished himself.” Florida’s Republican National Committeeman, Peter Feaman, similarly said he couldn’t think of a “high or low point” for Trump in the debate. But he said Trump did accomplish one important task: He proved he could appear presidential, addressing a weakness that has dogged him among some Republicans in the swing state with the largest haul of electoral votes. “It was pretty plain. I don’t think it contained what a lot of the viewers were hoping to see, which were fireworks. That wasn’t the goal at this point,” he said. Trump certainly didn’t deliver anything to persuade Sandra Kase, who serves on the Kingston municipal council in Luzerne County. A lifelong Republican who says she cannot vote for Clinton, Kase said Trump allowed the Democratic nominee to bait him, raising questions about his judgment and his ability to control his temper with world leaders. Equally worrisome, the GOP nominee failed to make strides toward winning over women like Kase in a state where Clinton holds a 14-point edge of Trump among likely women voters, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. “Just his attitude toward women, sexism, everything that comes out of his mouth turns me off. I’m sorry, I can’t say a good thing about him,” she said. “Just the whole atmosphere of the debate, his whole attitude, his reaction — I don’t think he has the temperament. As soon as someone goads him into something, he blasts out what we wants to say and feels that’s OK, and it’s not.”",true
"Everyone knows Arnold Palmer as being a spectacular golfer and the inventor of a drink that is a mix of lemonade and iced tea. (I personally thank him for the last one, because I am in love with Arnold Palmers, especially in the summer months.)  Aside from being a great athlete, Palmer was also a great American, as evidenced by his comments about the Star Spangled Banner. “We don’t play ‘The Star-Spangled Banner’ enough during the matches, and that is one of the things I think we need to do,” Palmer said then. “It’s a patriotic situation, and it belongs to both sides,” Palmer added. These comments came after the National Football League saw the beginning of the sitting protests that have sparked so much outrage. This weekend, we saw DeSean Jackson of the Washington Redskins greet our National Anthem with a raised fist, which is being used as a symbol of solidarity with the black community. He later made a statement on Instagram: “No matter how much or what we stand 4 as black people this will continue to happen , another Love 1 is taking from his family and killed unarmed , when will this s— stop , this man was shot & killed for what ?? Was he a threat ?? Us as black People are a threat , so jus take our lives smh the system been set up for us not to live and make it thru all this Bull—- another RIP #terrencecrutcher but they say have faith & trust ?? In what Them to keep killing our love 1’s,” he posted. The Giants played Washington that weekend and all of the players stood for the anthem. Later, he questioned whether these gestures on the field are actually being turned into actions. “Does anybody want to resolve the issues? That’s what we have to find out,” said running back Rashad Jennings. “We’re talking about gestures. The gesture of taking a knee, the gesture of posting something (on social media). Those are all gestures. It’s whether the actions are taking place,” he said. We need more athletes like Palmer who love their sport and love the country that has made their life and lifestyle possible. ",true
"Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump ushered the 2016 presidential campaign into a new phase tonight, and they did it with plenty of barbs. The two candidates faced off in their first general election debate at Hofstra University in Long Island, New York, in front of what was expected to be a historic number of television viewers. Here are 10 moments that mattered at the first general election presidential debate:        Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have lobbed insults at each other from far away for months, but tonight they tried to start their highly anticipated face off on a genteel note, although the mutual contempt was just below the surface. When Clinton walked out in a red pantsuit and Trump in a blue tie -- the opponents’ trading traditional party colors -- the two shook hands and Clinton said, “How are you, Donald?” Perhaps trying to throw him off at the top with a warm greeting. Shortly after the debate began, Trump talked about overseas trade deals, saying, “But in all fairness to Secretary Clinton,” before stopping himself and turning to his opponent and saying, “Yes, is that OK? Good. I want you to be very happy. It's very important to me.” He seemed to be referring to his addressing her as “Secretary Clinton,” although it wasn’t completely clear during the moment.  Clinton was first to go on the attack during tonight’s debate, taking aim at Trump’s business roots by claiming he borrowed $14 million from his father to start his real estate business. “Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we'll be and that everything will work out from there. I don't buy that. I have a different experience,” Clinton said, before expanding on her father’s work as a drapery maker. Trump responded to that personal claim rather than addressing her subsequent remarks that he believes in “trumped up, trickle-down” economics. “For one thing, and before we start on that, my father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,” Trump said.  Voters saw the first fiery moment of the debate when the two candidates sparred over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Trump accused Clinton of supporting TPP, the proposed trade agreement between the United States and 11 other countries along the Pacific Rim. “And now you want to approve Trans-Pacific Partnership. You were totally in favor of it,” Trump said. Clinton fired back, “Well, that is just not accurate. I was against it once it was finally negotiated and the terms were laid out.” Trump then pointed to Clinton’s once referring to TPP as the “gold standard of trade deals.” “Well, Donald, I know you live in your own reality, but that is not the facts,” Clinton said. Clinton promoted TPP as secretary of state under President Obama, who is pushing the trade deal. While speaking in Australia in November 15, 2012, Clinton said, ""TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.” Clinton came out against the trade deal October of last year, saying that “what I know about it as of today I am not in favor of what I have learned about it.”  Less than 30 minutes into the debate, Trump went after Clinton, attacking her on trade, ISIS, taxes, the economy and more. Clinton quipped: ""I have a feeling by the end of this evening I'm going to be blamed for everything that's ever happened.” Trump didn’t miss a beat, saying to his opponent: “Why not?” Clinton responded: ""Why not? Yeah. Why not? Just join the debate by saying more crazy things. Now, let me say this—“ Trump interjected: ""There's nothing crazy about not letting our companies bring their money back into the country,” before the moderator reminded Trump, ""This is secretary Clinton's two minutes, please.""    Trump clashed with his Democratic rival over his decision not to release his tax returns. “I don't mind releasing. I'm under a routine audit and it will be released,” he said. Trump went on to tout his disclosure of a different federally mandated form required by the U.S. Office of Government Ethics of everyone from presidential candidates to the postmaster general. Trump then pivoted to attack Clinton over her private email server. “I will release my tax returns against my lawyer's wishes when she releases her 33,000 e-mails that have been deleted,” he said. “I think you've just seen another example of bait and switch here. For 40 years, everyone running for president has release their tax returns,” she said. “You got to ask yourself: Why won't he release his tax returns? “Maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes,” she said.  Moderator Lester Holt asked Trump “what took you so long” to acknowledge that President Obama was born in the United States, bringing the Republican nominee’s recent turnaround on an issue that was central to his public positions for years. At first, Trump claimed that two Clinton aides were the ones who initially looked into Barack Obama’s birth certificate during the 2008 campaign -- a claim that he has made before -- and then said that he was “satisfied” with when Obama released his birth certificate. Holt noted that Obama released his longform birth certificate in 2011, but Trump continued to raise questions about it’s authenticity until 2015. “Nobody was pressing it, nobody was caring much about it,” Trump said, referencing the years between the release and Trump’s decision this month to acknowledge Obama was born in America. “I figured you'd ask the question tonight, of course. But nobody was caring much about it. But I was the one that got him to produce the birth certificate, and I think I did a good job.”    Trump was talking about crime in the inner cities when he said, “I’ve been all over the place. You decided to stay home and that's OK,” seeming to jab Clinton for leaving the campaign trail in recent days to prepare for tonight’s faceoff. ""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,” Clinton said. ""And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think that's a good thing.” Throughout the debate, Clinton tried to portray Trump as unprepared and unwilling to do the hard work to prepare for the presidency. She also hit back against an attack he regularly makes on the campaign trail: That she doesn't stump as much as he does because she doesn't have his endurance.  Trump’s support of stop and frisk, a controversial tactic once heavily used by the New York Police Department, was discussed at length during the debate. “Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did, it had a very very big impact,” Trump said. Trump said that the tactic was not deemed unconstitutional -- which it was -- and added instead that “it went before a judge who was a very against-police judge.” “They would have won an appeal,” he said, noting that there was no appeal. Trump and Clinton went on to debate various crime rates in cities like Chicago and New York for nearly 10 minutes of the debate.  Toward the end of the debate, Holt corrected Trump on whether he supported the war in Iraq before it started. “I did not support the war in Iraq,” Trump said. ""That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her because she frankly I think the best person in her campaign is mainstream media.” Holt corrected him, saying, “The record shows otherwise.” The only time Trump seems to have spoken about the war publicly before it started was to Howard Stern in 2002 and seemed to support the invasion. Stern asked Trump, “Are you for invading Iraq?"" Trump appeared to hesitate, responding, “Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly.” Despite the attempt to correct him, Trump continued to stress he was against the war, saying, “The record shows that I am right.”  Holt asked Trump about when he once said that Clinton does not have a “presidential look,” asking Trump what he meant by that. Trump pivoted to attack her “stamina.” ""She doesn't have the look, she doesn’t have the stamina,” Trump said. ""I said she doesn't have the stamina. And I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.” Trump has been hitting Clinton on her stamina and strength on the campaign trail for months, but tonight Clinton tried to shut that line of attack down. ""Well, as soon as he travels to 112 countries and negotiates a peace deal, a cease-fire, a release of dissidents, an opening of new opportunities and nations around the world, or even spends 11 hours testifying in front of a congressional committee, he can talk to me about stamina,” Clinton said. She also attempted to remind voters of some of the more controversial things he has said about women: ""One thing Lester, he tried to switch from looks to stamina,” Clinton said. ""But this is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs. And someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers. Who has said women don't deserve equal pay unless they do as good a job as men.”",true
"The preliminary numbers are in, and they suggest that the first presidential debate of 2016 between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be the most watched debate going back decades. With the first presidential debate of 2012 averaging 70 million viewers, last night is looking like a massive night for TV news. The numbers from all the channels will be made available by Nielsen over the course of the day. All told, the early numbers continue to show that 2016 just seems to keep getting better for TV news channels. And with the presidential campaign nearing its final stretch, the first forecasts are coming in for just how good the Trumped-up 2016 presidential campaign has been to them. With the 2016 election’s pivotal events delivering record ratings moments every few months (highest rated primary debate, highest rated primary election night coverage, etc), CNN and Fox News are poised to have the most-watched years in their respective histories, stretching back to 1980 for CNN and 1996 for Fox News. MSNBC has a chance to do so as well. Many networks reported that they’d “sold out” their first debate night early, and are expecting the same for the next three. Story Continued Below And that means money. According to data from media and communications data firm SNL Kagan, a division of SMP Global Market Intelligence, the three major cable news networks are set to make nearly $2 billion in ad revenues, and the three main business networks are set to add another $458 million in ad revenue from just the 2016 calendar year. “We’ve been outselling our election packages for a year now,” said Katrina Cukaj, EVP of Portfolio Sales & Client Partnerships for Turner Ad Sales, which includes CNN. “We are close to selling out for the rest of the [election related] days; there is very high demand. Very high.” Fox News is expecting a “multimillion dollar revenue night” when all the money is counted. According to the Wall Street Journal, CNN is selling debate and election night ad packages with minimums of $800,000 to $1 million, with 30 second ads for the presidential debates going for more than $55,000. Other cable news channels are selling similar bundled ad packages. And those kinds of numbers take into account that there are no ad interruptions during the debate – all those ads are sold against pre- and post-game analysis and panels. “There is considerably higher demand in this election cycle with higher price points compared to the other election cycles,” an NBC source said. According to SNL Kagan, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC will combine for approximately $1.96 billion in gross ad sales in 2016. Compare that to $1.72 million in calendar year 2015 (which saw a number of high-profile primary debates), and $1.56 million in calendar year 2012, the last presidential election year. The ad revenue makes sense when you look at the numbers. The first Republican debate in August of 2015 brought in a record-breaking 24 million viewers for Fox News. Fox News’ March debate in Detroit, Michigan averaged just under 17 million viewers. Through March and April, big primary nights would draw an average of 10-12 million viewers across cable news and on 10 p.m. broadcast specials. Those sorts of ratings are typically reserved for major sporting events like NFL games, or huge hit shows like NCIS. This election cycle has been delivering them with regularity, even if they are spread out across a number of channels. The election is also broadening the types of advertisers who are hoping to catch the eyeballs of the big election audiences. Cukaj said she’s seen an uptick in entertainment and movie advertisements. “Movie studios and entertainment has been very, very active in these big election events, they enjoy the nice big ratings these live events do,” Cukaj said. Fox News EVP of advertising sales Paul Rittenberg told AdWeek “there's substantially more demand from [advertisers] who didn't used to buy a lot of news; we even have a beer [company].” That company is Tecate, which was running a debate-specific ad about a “wall” on Fox News, Univision and Telemundo during the pre and post-debate shows. (In fact, the wall never came up in the debate.) Among the entertainment advertisers is Epix, which aired a faux-cable news segment before last night’s debate, featuring cable news regulars Michael Steele, Amy Holmes and Barney Frank. CNN had to run a gold banner over the “segment” to ensure viewers knew it was not CNN content. For the broadcast networks, the 2016 campaign has largely been a boon, even if election-related programming has occasionally competed with or preempted more lucrative entertainment and sports programming (at $200,000 per 30 second spot, the debate programming would be very similar to what standard entertainment fare would bring in). Still, this broadcast season, news programming has been one of the few bright spots, with most entertainment and sports programming seeing ratings declines compared to last year. The broadcast networks CBS and NBC are selling 30 second ads for more than $200,000 each, according to the Journal. Advertising rates for the presidential debates may not be as high as some primary debates were, as they do not have commercial breaks, so all ads run before and after the debate when the channels are doing pre- and post-debate analysis (in case you were wondering why there is so much of it, the answer is: inventory!) For the networks, that eats into valuable prime-time real estate, where entertainment programming can command higher premiums. There’s another reason debates like the one last night aren’t quite as valuable as they could be: Scarcity, or lack thereof. With the debate airing on more than 10 TV channels, and streaming on hundreds of websites, the audience will be massive, but highly fragmented. In fact, despite the massive 2016 haul, the picture for television news continues to be bleak. For one thing, news networks these days are making less than half their money from advertising, so ""big years"" don't have nearly the lasting effect they might otherwise. Where does the rest of their revenue come from? For big networks like CNN, a lot of it comes from “carriage fees” – the lucrative contracts the big news networks sign with cable providers like Comcast, Time Warner Cable and Charter Communications in return for allowing their channel to appear on the carriers’ channel line-ups. These deals – which can be contentious and result in channel blackouts with individual providers but usually, ultimately go the TV networks' way – are often negotiated in multi-year terms. Time Warner CFO Howard Averill said that next year, 2017, will deliver record profits for CNN, beating 2016 despite this year’s election boost. Previously negotiated carriage fee increases guarantee that result, even if the channel sees a steep ratings decline. And that’s just one place where the connection between audience size and revenue is deteriorating. In fact, while 2016 may top the revenue charts, the three big cable news networks have actually been on the rebound since 2013, with all three increasing ad revenue every year since then. These good signs are generally taken with a grain of salt behind the closed doors of the TV businesses’ executive suites. The chief worries: Television audiences are aging out of the TV news ecosystem, and not being replaced by younger viewers coveted by advertisers. Over time, this will also depress audience numbers, as those aging viewers are replaced by fewer young viewers growing into engagement with TV news. And indeed, not everyone has shared in the big bounty of 2016. Local ad revenue, which relies heavily on political spending, has not been as strong as anticipated. SNL Kagan downgraded their projected income of $3.3 billion for local television down to $3.1 billion partly as a result of Trump not spending as much on advertising. Sinclair Broadcasting, the country’s largest owner of TV stations, warned investors last week that 2016 political ad spending was falling short of expectations. Ironically, the presence of Donald Trump in the 2016 campaign, often discussed as if it were the reason this election is such a television draw, is a factor in that slump. “While we previously anticipated a decline in presidential ad spending in the third quarter based on the late fund-raising by the Trump campaign, we have yet to see significant spending, even at the levels we initially anticipated,” Sinclair CFO Chris Ripley said at a conference hosted by Goldman Sachs. CBS CEO Les Moonves told attendees at the same conference that his local station revenue was on track, but much of that was coming in from local and statewide races and issue campaigns. As far as the presidential campaign, there was one big reason Moonves pointed to to describe the unexpected slump: “To generalize, [there is not as much spending from] the top of the tickets, because Mr. Trump does not appear to be spending as much as people thought.” — Additional reporting by Kelsey Sutton",true
"Washington (CNN)Eager to motivate his own base of supporters to vote in this year's contest, President Barack Obama will begin appearing in more advertising for Hillary Clinton, the White House said Tuesday. Speaking a day after the first presidential debate, Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Obama would ramp up his role in the 2016 race as Election Day nears. ""I think through October, the President will be increasing his involvement in this race, and that doesn't just mean through travel,"" Earnest said. ""That also means that the President will feature more prominently in the advertising efforts of Secretary Clinton and Democrats across the country."" Earnest said the ads would appear on television, radio and online. A message left with the Clinton campaign about the spots, including how much money would be spent on them, was not immediately returned. Obama has appeared at two campaign stops for Clinton, and further stops are expected to be announced in the coming days. Both Vice President Joe Biden and First Lady Michelle Obama are making campaign stops for Clinton in Pennsylvania this week. Democrats hope Obama can convince the bloc of supporters who backed him in 2008 and 2012 -- comprised of African-Americans, young people and women -- to get behind Clinton this cycle. While Earnest didn't specify Tuesday when or where the ads featuring Obama would run, aides have identified North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Florida as states where the President is likely to hold sway. ""I think you're going to continue to hear the President warn against complacency,"" Earnest said Tuesday. ""He'll be looking to maximize the time he is able to make available to support Secretary Clinton."" He said Obama would spend ""one to two"" days per week on the trail for Clinton in early October, with a ramp-up possible at the end of the month. But he cautioned against using travel alone as a gauge of Obama's engagement. ""There are a variety of other ways for the President to get engaged,"" he said, citing radio interviews and ads. ""I think the President will be visible, but that doesn't always include headlining a rally."" CNN's Dan Merica contributed to this report.",true
"Boise, Idaho (CNN)Donald Trump Jr. said Thursday he was surprised by the reaction to his tweet comparing Syrian refugees to Skittles because he was ""trying to point out things that have to be said."" ""People will today make what they want of anything and they see the worst in everything and they look for subtext that doesn't exist,"" Trump told reporters after a fundraiser here. ""For me, I guess I'm a straightforward guy. I don't deal in microagression, where it takes a special kind of person to find whatever message they're looking for."" The tweet -- which consisted of a photo of a bowl full of the candy that said: ""If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem."" -- took center stage on the campaign trail earlier this week. A top aide to Hillary Clinton called it ""disgusting"" and Clinton supporters attacking the comparison as crass and inhumane. But Trump supporters -- and the Trump campaign itself -- have repeatedly defended Trump and the tweet. Mars, which produces Skittles, rejected the comparison in a statement, saying, ""Skittles are candy. Refugees are people. We don't feel it's an appropriate analogy."" Trump said he didn't ""want to be a distraction"" to the campaign, but that the negative response was being driven by partisan attacks. ""I understand that running as conservative, there is a different standard,"" he said. ""If a metaphor offends someone then maybe that's the world in which we live today, but I'm not comparing someone to candy,"" Trump said. ""It's a statistical thing. We have to be careful about who we let into this country."" But the statistics don't actually back up the contention made in the tweet. According to a recent Cato Institute report, the odds ""that an American would be killed in a terrorist attack committed by a refugee was 1 in 3.64 billion a year."" Still, Trump said Thursday that it was his broader point was what mattered and that it was part of a discussion that needed to be had and one that tracked closely with the key components of his father's campaign strategy. ""He's created some good dialogue that needed to be had that wasn't being had because PC culture sort of forced real issues off of the table,"" Trump said of his father's campaign. ""The way he's been able to approach that and do that has forced people to actually have a dialogue and that's what this country is about, having that dialogue."" That dialogue -- about race, about refugees and about immigrants -- has been harshly criticized by Clinton and Trump detractors as racist, but Trump countered that it has been the driving force behind Trump's success. ""We're not a country where everything has to be in a safe space,"" Trump said. ""That's not what built this country, that's not what made this country great and that's why my father is resonating so well with working class, hard-working Americans. He's giving them a voice again."" ",true
"When Donald Trump talks about America, he often talks about how we don’t “win anymore.” We don’t win on manufacturing. We don’t win on trade. We don’t win on economics. We don’t win against ISIS. It’s that last point I wish to address, because Trump said at a recent rally: “Our military can’t beat ISIS. Can you imagine the great General Douglas MacArthur or the great General George Patton saying we can’t beat ISIS. Patton would rip your heart out if you ever said that. We can’t beat – right? Can you imagine that though? Can you imagine what – they’re spinning right now. They’re watching. They’re spinning in their grave.” You, Donnie Trump, go on, and speak like MacArthur and Patton talk to you. You sound like you’ve assured them you can win here, and you’ll do them proud. Is that how you see it, Donnie? You’re ignoring an awful lot there, Donnie. Neither MacArthur nor Patton behaved the way you do. They were tacticians, not juggernauts who rolled to victory in every single engagement. They knew when to steamroll, and when to pull back and regroup. In your crusade against anything that even remotely looks like weakness, you’ve taught your dense and idiotic followers that winning against ISIS is as simple as a football game. Simply act like we can win, and we’ll win. I’m sure that our dear Mr. Trump does not see anything wrong with talking this way. After all, nothing he ever does is wrong. Period. End of. However, the problem is not how he sees it. The problem is the message he’s putting forth. He’s treating war, and terrorism, like they’re football games. If we just think positively, believe we can win, and stop acting like we can’t beat ISIS, we’ll beat them handily. That’s not true. Generals Patton and MacArthur were so successful in part because they were realistic. There were massive failures during WWII. We did not ride in on this white horse to save the day. However, Donnie disgustingly buys into that very narrative. We didn’t. MacArthur was already in the Philippines when Japan attacked Pearl Harbor. In the ensuing months, he suffered grievous defeats. He actually ordered a withdrawal to Australia to regroup. He was human. His troops were human. Japan was a juggernaut at the time, and we couldn’t beat them with brute force. What do you think of that, Donnie? MacArthur actually a Isn’t that giving up? Isn’t that what you’re railing against? MacArthur is remembered as great of things like this. Not in spite of them, and definitely not because they didn’t happen. Then there’s Patton. He does seem to have been more the style that you see in your head. For instance, he’s reported to have said: “We shall attack and attack until we are exhausted, and then we shall attack again.” Yet he was surrounded by controversy over his leadership methods. Congress and the military actually demanded his removal from command after he slapped a soldier who was suffering from battle fatigue. There were other such incidents, too, but his qualifications are what kept him in the field. He might have stormed through battle zones like Bastogne (do you even know which battle that was, Donnie?), ending them, but he was far from perfect. Donnie, all you do is talk about winning and losing, and yet, nobody has ever conceded defeat to ISIS. Nobody in U.S. leadership has said, “We can’t beat ISIS.” Not our president, not our current commanders. A coach telling his football team “We can’t do this,” hands the game to the other team. Our military doesn’t operate like that, however. It never has. It operates with the understanding that there will be defeats. Learning from those defeats is key to beating ISIS — something you would know if you weren’t such a conceited bastard. On the ground, unit commanders, all the way down to squad leaders, will give pep talks. Yes, that is normal, and you and I both know it. However, those who are guiding the entire war have to be realistic, or they will end up losing it, and they know it. It’s not a football game. ISIS is not WWII, and it’s not a game, Donnie. Your treating it as such doesn’t just show astonishing arrogance, but it also shows that you’re wholly unqualified to be the Commander in Chief of the U.S. military. You will be able to understand how anything works as long as you keep treating everything as winning versus losing. As though it’s a goddamn football game. It’s not. ",true
"Legendary athlete Michael Jordan made a statement about the racial violence and tension with there law enforcement community.   Jordan said, “As a proud American, a father who lost his own dad in a senseless act of violence, and a black man, I have been deeply troubled by the deaths of African-Americans at the hands of law enforcement. And angered by the cowardly and hateful targeting and killing of police officers. I grieve with the families who have lost loved ones, as I know their pain all too well.” He went on, “I was raised by parents who taught me to love and respect people regardless of their race or background, so I am saddened and frustrated by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse as of late. I know this country is better than that, and I can no longer stay silent. We need to find solutions that ensure people of color receive fair and equal treatment AND that police officers—who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all—are respected and supported.” Jordan went on to talk about and praise law enforcement and how they have helped and protected him and his family in the past. But, he also acknowledged the fact that many African Americans do not feel the same way and have had a tremendously different experience with police that is not necessarily positive. The most touching part of his statements was when he called for change and for everybody to work together to attain that outcome. The star finished by saying, “To support that efforts, I am making contributions of $1 million each to two organizations, the International Association of Chiefs of Police’s newly established Institute for Community-Police Relations and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. Although I know these contributions alone are not enough to solve the problem, I hope the resources will help both organizations make a positive difference.” People on Twitter and social media were quick to call him an Uncle Tom saying that his money was not needed and won’t make a difference. What he did though is highly profound. Not only did he acknowledge that yes, there is a problem in which African Americans are disproportionately discriminated against by police, he also acknowledged that most police officers are good people and deserve to be safe, healthy, and respected. He is able to come at it from both angles. And he put his money where his mouth is by donating a significant portion of money. A man of talk and action. Which is what is missing. Everyone talks but no one takes action. He did just that. Unlike another person who shall remain unnamed.. cough cough (Colin Kaepernick). He is able to see both sides and as an African American man who says that he will likley have a far greater impact than if a white man said it. It’s the voices of our friends we listen  to most. Whether we want to admit it or not, black people don’t want to hear white people preaching about racism. But when a black man says something they are more apt to listen. ",fake
"For the first time in its 126-year history, The Arizona Republic has endorsed a Democratic candidate for president. The paper's editorial board said Hillary Clinton is ""the only choice to move America ahead."" ""Since The Arizona Republic began publication in 1890, we have never endorsed a Democrat over a Republican for president. Never. This reflects a deep philosophical appreciation for conservative ideals and Republican principles,"" the paper's editorial board wrote. ""This year is different."" The editorial said Clinton's temperament and experience prepare her for office, while it questioned Donald Trump for not releasing his tax returns, asking ""whose hand do you want on the nuclear button?"" Clinton has racked up her fair share of nontraditional endorsements from newspapers. Last week, The Cincinnati Enquirer, which noted it had backed Republican candidates for president “for almost a century,"" also endorsed Clinton. Earlier this month, The Dallas Morning News endorsed the former secretary of state, making her the first Democrat that newspaper has endorsed in over 75 years.",true
"A reporter for VICE News was arrested this weekend trying to get his press pass from the Trump campaign. Donald Trump attacked New York Times writer Maureen Dowd on Twitter for a negative story â Â a routine practice for the Republican presidential nominee. Heâs blacklisted reporters throughout the election and treated them so badly theyâve had to be escorted out of his rallies by Secret Service officers. He says he wants to âopen upâ libel laws, which would weaken journalistsâ ability to report hard-hitting stories. He sued websites for writing that his wife and theÂ potential first lady was rumored to be a Slovenian hooker. And Monday, Trump made a comment about the press that is arguably one of his worst yet. In an interview with âFox & Friendsâ on Fox News, Trump was speaking about the latest terrorist attacks in New York and New Jersey that occurred over the weekend. After blaming refugees, despite there being absolutely no evidence the refugee program is to blame, the hosts mentioned that people donât need to be radicalized in Syria or IraqÂ becauseÂ they can simply go online to be indoctrinated by terrorist groups. Trump turned his sites on a constitutionally protected right, the freedom of press and expression: âTheyâre all talking about it so wonderfully because, you know, itâs called âfreedom of the press,â where you buy magazines and they tell you how to make these same bombs that I saw.â Trump then said he was totally in favor of freedom of the press, then turned right around and shat on freedom of the press saying they are âinciting violence.â âThey tell you how to make bombs. We should arrest the people that do that because theyâre participating in crime. Instead, they say âoh no you canât do anything, thatâs freedom of expression.â â And Trump also alluded to the fact that information on the internet should not be freely available (kind of like China): âThe websites are the same thing, those people should be arrested. Theyâre inciting violence, okay? Theyâre making violence possible. They should be arrested immediatelyâ¦yet we donât want to touch them because of freedom of speech.â Incitement is not a constitutionally protected right, but itâs hard to prove that by making information available a website owner or writer is intentionally inciting a specific crime. But if the bar is lowered, Trump himself could be arrested for incitement, after telling his supporters to take out protesters at his rallies, or his comment that âSecond Amendment peopleâ could stop Clinton. Trumpâs problem with the media is troubling. Using these latest attacks to go after constitutionally protected freedomsÂ reeks of Bush-era fear-mongering that led to the U.S. giving up privacy rights to the government. Trump has left a long trail of breadcrumbs showing us heâs on a path to destroy the First Amendment as we know it. Freedom of expression and press is considered to be the fourth pillar of democracy in this country, without those freedoms the press is just a propaganda machine for the person in power. Only a small man fears information. Featured Image via Getty Images/Gustavo Caballero",fake
"Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight’s debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States. The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon – thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016  What’s curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from – which will come as quite a surprise:  Data is from Trendsmap.com That’s right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin’s agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It’s a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin’s trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences. Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe. The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: “humourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.” So remember – don’t trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.   ",fake
"With just 50 days until the election, Donald Trump is facing a staggering — and perhaps historic — organizational disadvantage. According to a POLITICO review of campaign spending, Hillary Clinton has invested seven times the amount of money on TV commercials as her Republican rival and has established twice as many field offices in many of the states that will decide who wins the presidency. In many battlegrounds, she has dozens more organizers than Trump. Story Continued Below While Trump, a first-time politician who has surrounded himself with advisers who are new to the rigors of presidential campaigns, has made serious headway in a number of battlegrounds in recent days, his on-the-ground and in-the-air deficits could be what stands between him and 270 electoral votes. “We’re in completely untested waters,” said David Kochel, an Iowa-based Republican operative who is leading a study group at the Harvard Institute of Politics contrasting the traditional campaign approach adopted by Clinton with the non-traditional one being used by Trump. “There has never been such a wide disparity in resource allocation as we're seeing in 2016.” The question, though, may be whether Trump’s lack of infrastructure matters in an election cycle that has so far rewarded a low-budget approach built on free media and mass rallies rather than TV ads and door-knocking. Last week, Smart Media Group, a media buying firm that works with the Republican National Committee, sent an email to a group of top Trump advisers, including campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, TV ad maker Larry Weitzner, and senior communications adviser Jason Miller, briefing them on the latest in commercial spending. The numbers were startling. As of Sept. 12, the email noted, Trump had spent $17 million on TV ads, a small fraction of the $126 million Clinton had invested. When outside groups were added to the mix, Trump’s deficit was even greater -- $33 million to Clinton’s $244 million. Trump aides say the figures reflect a simple reality: Their funds are limited. Through the end of July, Clinton and her outside group allies had raised a combined $435 million to Trump’s $160 million – a difference of more than two-to-one, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Unlike Clinton, a powerful fundraiser, Trump has struggled to attract the support of deep-pocketed donors, many of whom have been repelled by his candidacy. Those working for pro-Trump super PACs are racing to find a solution. Advisers to one of the groups, Rebuilding America Now, are openly discussing the possibility that Rick Scott, the wealthy Florida governor who is chairing the super PAC, may soon provide it with a contribution. Clinton has used her TV barrage to cast her Republican opponent as a dangerous, unpredictable figure who’s ill-suited suited to occupy the Oval Office. Last week, while Trump aired commercials in just four states, Clinton had spots running in nine battlegrounds. One Clinton ad that went into heavy rotation, titled “Sacrifice,” spotlighted critical comments Trump made about Arizona Sen. John McCain’s war record. Strategists from both parties say they cannot recall the last time a presidential nominee has been so dominated on the TV airwaves. The seven-to-one ratio confronting Trump far eclipses the five-to-four margin President Barack Obama faced in 2012 and the two-to-one ratio McCain encountered in 2008. With early voting in some battlegrounds opening in just days, the race is entering its most intense phase yet. And while Clinton has established formidable operations in many key states, Trump has far fewer full-time staffers to get out the vote, according to figures provided by campaign aides, national party officials, and swing-state operatives. In must-win Ohio, where early voting begins on Oct. 12, Clinton has around 250 organizers and 50 offices. Trump, meanwhile, has roughly 110 staffers and 30 offices. Republicans say Gov. John Kasich’s persistent refusal to endorse Trump has hurt the nominee, depriving him of man-power. Many of Kasich’s longest-serving aides, including Jeffrey Polesovsky and Jai Chabria, have decided to sit on the sidelines. Chabria, a former Kasich senior adviser, said Trump was behind in a state where appealing to low-propensity voters was a weeks-long process that couldn’t be done overnight. “It’s a very late effort by the Trump folks to play catch up, and the Democrats and the Clinton campaign have been here for a long time. That’s going to have an effect,” he said. “Big rallies are really nice, but actual campaigns matter in Ohio.” In North Carolina, where Trump has around 170 staffers and 10 offices, Clinton has over 250 workers and 30 offices. Democrats say they are implementing a detailed plan aimed at intensifying turnout among black and college-educated voters, demographic groups that Trump has struggled with. Last month, Clinton brought aboard Dan Kanninen, who played a key role in Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns, to help oversee her campaign in the state. In New Hampshire, it’s a similar story. While Trump has fewer than 50 full-time organizers and just a handful of offices, Clinton has around 100 staffers and 25 offices. “Two months out, I think Hillary has a stronger operation than Trump up here. That’s pretty apparent from the number of staff, the number of offices, and the number commercials,” said Jim Merrill, a veteran Republican strategist who oversaw Marco Rubio’s primary bid in New Hampshire and held similar positions on Mitt Romney’s two presidential campaigns. “Trump is behind where we were in 2012.” In even conservative bastions, Clinton is developing formidable infrastructure. In Arizona, Clinton has around 160 staffers and 25 offices, and in Georgia she has roughly 40 organizers and 10 offices. In that state, Tracey Lewis, who worked on Michelle Nunn's 2014 Georgia Senate bid, recently signed on as a senior advisor. Republicans declined to detail their numbers in the two conservative states but acknowledged that Clinton had a bigger field presence. While Trump advisers concede they’re behind in the ground war, they insist they’re making serious gains. The campaign, for example, said it had improved its footing in Florida after engineering a recent staff shuffle. State director Karen Giorno, who’d clashed with many members of the Trump team, was replaced with Susie Wiles, a former top adviser to Scott, the Florida governor. Yet in an election that’s so far been driven by daily headlines, some are wondering if textbook campaign metrics like TV ads and field staffers will matter as much as they have in previous years. Some are coming to the conclusion that the New York businessman’s lack of swing-state infrastructure might not be fatal. Throughout his campaign, Trump has invested relatively little on TV ads and field deployment – instead surviving off his ability to pack rallies and generate overwhelming media attention for speeches and statements large and small. On Thursday morning, during a meeting convened by Trump’s congressional supporters on Capitol Hill, Conway said the Republican nominee would give multiple addresses each week focusing on specific policies he’d implement as president. “The fact that the numbers have moved gradually in Trump’s favor in spite of the onslaught of spending by Hillary causes a lot of head-scratching,” said Kochel, who was chief strategist on Jeb Bush’s presidential campaign. “But the voters are getting their information in a thousand different ways outside of the campaigns’ control.”",true

"Donald Trump is a racist, Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid said on the Senate floor Monday afternoon, and the media has been negligent by refusing to label him as such. “Virtually every time Donald Trump says or does something discriminatory -- and that's often -- the media relies upon a catalog of buzzwords to describe his actions,” Reid (D-Nev.) said Monday. “The press uses words like hateful, intolerant, bigot, extremist, prejudice, to name but a few. Yet there's always one word that many of the press conspicuously avoid: racist. They never label Trump as a racist. But he is a racist. Donald Trump is a racist.” Story Continued Below In his Senate floor remarks, Reid said “racist is a term I don’t throw around lightly,” and detailed a handful of the allegations of discriminatory behavior leveled against the GOP nominee. The Nevada senator recalled the housing discrimination lawsuit filed against Trump in the 1970s, when his real estate company was sued for steering minority applicants away from buildings with mostly white tenants and marking their applications with a “c” or the number nine. He also quoted a former employee of one of Trump’s Atlantic City, New Jersey, casinos who recalled an edict from the Manhattan billionaire that black employees be pulled off the casino floor whenever he visited. Reid said Trump’s racism has “reached new heights” during his White House bid. He ticked off Trump’s support for the so-called “birther” movement, his proposal to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States and his comment — uttered when he first announced his candidacy — that Mexican immigrants ""are bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists, and some, I assume, are good people.” He also highlighted Trump’s attacks against U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, who the Manhattan billionaire has accused of bias in presiding over a fraud case against him because of the judge’s Mexican heritage. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) called Trump’s attacks “the textbook definition of a racist comment.” “Here we are seven weeks from Election Day, and the speaker of the house and Senate Republican leader are both endorsing this racist man. We probably should not support a man for president who by their speaker's own admission is a textbook definition of a racist,” Reid said. “Think of the example he's setting for our nation's youth. Republicans are normalizing this racist behavior. This will be their legacy, one of them. They got plenty to add to that.” “It's time for Republicans to stop closing their eyes to Donald Trump's racism, and it's time for reporters and journalists to be honest with the American people,” Reid added. “They owe America the truth. Through his words and deeds, Donald Trump is a racist.”",true
"Social Security has been called the third rail of American politics: Touch it and you die. And if that is indeed the case, then Donald Trump might want to start picking out a nice casket. Bloomberg is reporting that when the GOP nominee met with Paul Ryan on May 12, he told the House Speaker that he does indeed favor cutting Social Security, but he’s afraid to say so publicly because it would doom his chances in November. Bloomberg cites an unnamed source who was in the room when the meeting was held. According to the source, Trump told Ryan: “From a moral standpoint, I believe in it. But you also have to get elected. And there’s no way a Republican is going to beat a Democrat when the Republican is saying, ‘We’re going to cut your Social Security’ and the Democrat is saying, ‘We’re going to keep it and give you more.’ ” This is in stark contrast to what Trump has repeatedly said on the campaign trail. Trump has said time and time again that he would leave Social Security alone. Alex Lawson, executive director of Social Security Works, believes the real intent of Trump is the same as that of most Republicans: Drastically cutting benefits while pretending to support the program: “It is really clear: Donald Trump would 100 percent go along with the Republican donor class position of cutting Social Security. He openly says he will lie to the people about it because he knows that the people are against it. “In his eyes the ‘moral’ thing to do is to steal people’s hard-earned benefits and not talk about it.”   As we have seen repeatedly during the 2016 campaign, Trump lies about everything, reverses his positions on issues by the hour, and often seems to be utterly lost when asked for specifics about various policy questions. The man is an idiot. He is also a danger to the very essence of American democracy. Featured Image Via Flickr available under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic License",fake

"Washington (CNN)The Senate will vote Wednesday to override President Barack Obama's veto of a bill to give victims and families of the 9/11 terrorist attacks the legal right to sue Saudi Arabia for any purported role in the plot, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday. The measure will need a two-thirds vote of the chamber to succeed -- which is expected -- before going to the House for a similar override vote later this week. It would be the first time in Obama's nearly eight years in office that one of his vetoes will be overturned. The President opposes the bill because he says it could open the door to lawsuits against the US for actions taken by military service members, diplomats and others. Obama expressed sympathy for the 9/11 families in his veto message Friday, but said he vetoed the bill because the law would hurt the effectiveness of the administration's action against terrorism by taking questions of foreign states' involvement in terrorism ""out of the hands of national security and foreign policy professionals and placing them in the hands of private litigants and courts."" In recent days, several senators who allowed the bill to pass without objection expressed misgivings for their decisions and said they wanted to find a way to address the White House's concerns about sovereign immunity. ""I have tremendous empathy for the victims,"" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee said two weeks ago. ""At the same time I have concerns about the precedent this bill will set and what it may mean to American service men and women and others. Let's face it -- our alleged drone attacks have killed civilians in Pakistan. Our alleged drone attacks have killed civilians in Afghanistan. And I think once you start opening the door for these types of activities it can be very problematic."" Despite those second thoughts, there was never much traction among lawmakers to prevent the override. Heavy lobbying by the Saudi government, which opposed the bill, was met by a more powerful force -- the emotional appeal of the 9/11 families who fanned out on Capitol Hill in recent weeks to prevent the bill from stalling. Once both chambers override the veto, the bill becomes law regardless of Obama's opposition. CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",true
"Over the weekend, Barack Obama addressed the Congressional Black Caucus for the last time as President. He hammered the Republican nominee and admonished black voters to vote for the Democratic nominee. He said he’d take it as a “personal insult” for members of the Black community not to vote for her. Here’s what he said: “If I hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn’t matter who we elect — read up on your history. It matters. We’ve got to get people to vote,” Obama said. “I will consider it a personal insult — an insult to my legacy — if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote.” Well, there’s at least one member of the Black community who doesn’t care that it would be a personal insult to the president for him to vote not only against Hillary, but for Donald Trump. He goes by A.D. Bell, and according to his Twitter profile, he’s an “Army Vet, Realist Party Affil., Father, College Graduate, Man, Not a Liberal or a Conservative.” In his video, Bell asks the President what he’s going to do to him, since he’s voting for Trump. When people say they’re “insulted,” they act on it, he said. “So, what are you going to do to me, Mr. Obama?” an incensed Bell asked. “I feel like liberals and Democrats have insulted me for a long time. I feel like liberals and Democrats have insulted black people for a long time.” “You know what I’m doing?! I’m voting against them!” he yelled, pointing to his camouflage ‘Make America Great Again’ hat.

"Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton is leading Donald Trump by 6 points ahead of the first debate on Monday, according to a new national poll released Wednesday. A four-way matchup shows Clinton has 43% support of likely voters while Trump has 37%, in the new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson is at 9% and the Green Party's Jill Stein is at 3%. In a two-way matchup, Clinton leads Trump by 7 points, 48% to 41%. Clinton on police shootings: 'too many people have lost their lives who shouldn't have' The poll was conducted after a rough patch for Clinton, highlighted by her temporarily leaving the campaign trail after she was diagnosed with pneumonia. Despite a recent effort to court African-American voters, Trump garners just 7% support compared to Clinton's 81% with the voting bloc. On the issues, Trump has the advantage with voters when it comes to the economy -- 46% to 41%. But Clinton leads when it comes to being in charge of nuclear weapons (51% to 25%), being a good commander in chief (48% to 33%) and on immigration (50% to 39%). Trump and Clinton are virtually tied when it comes to terrorism and homeland security (44% to 43%). A new CNN Poll of Polls, including the NBC/WSJ data, finds Clinton's edge over Trump has inched up by 1 point. The Poll of Polls averages the results of the five most recent nationwide telephone polls of presidential preference among likely voters and finds her ahead, 43% to 40%. The NBC/WSJ poll surveyed 992 likely voters between September 16-19 and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points. ",true
"Last night America finally got to see Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton together in the same room. And just as expected, there was some much pent up sparring. Once the evening had concluded, it was evident who won that debate, no questions asked: Hillary Clinton. No one should be surprised. While the media has been speculating that viewers would once again see a âTrump pivot,â the facts remain the same â what we saw on the debate stage was the same Trump we saw during the Republican primaries â a brash, condescending, loudmouthed bully who has no plans, only talking points. All the pundits know it. The polls know it. The people know it. Hillary Clinton won because she was prepared, she was eloquent, and she kept her cool. But not surprisingly, Trump and his band of surrogates didnât get the memo. They think they won. Because why not? Trump (and his people) say Lester Holt was unfair. They say the microphone was tampered with. They say Hillary Clinton was âtoo preparedâ so it was an unfair advantage. They say the media was too biased. Excuse after excuse, Trump refuses to take responsibility for his actions. he was unprepared, he was disrespectful, he couldnât elaborate, and he got personal. But enough about Trump and his candy-ass excuses. Letâs talk about why Hillary Clinton was clearly the winner. Look no further than her best zinger of the night: âI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate. And, yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be president. And I think thatâs a good thing.â Itâs been reported that Clinton immersed herself with the issues of our times, poring over research, conducting rehearsals, and doing her homework. Trump, on the other hand, was taking a casual, passive approach to the debates, and it showed. He couldnât elaborate, he didnât show decorum, and he didnât know how to respond to Clintonâs assertions â except with lies. The bar was set pretty low due to Trump. Clinton knew she had to somewhat get on his level, but stay true to who she really ishis debate ended up being something special. She was up against a loud, bombastic, unpredictable bully who says whatever he pleases. Luckily for her, she didnât take any of his lies personally. She fact checked him when Holt wouldnât. She smiled politely as he sunk into the abyss with his never ending rambles. She wasnât âtoo loudâ as the pundits like to call it, but she was forceful when need be. And, even though itâs a stupid assessment (but somehow matters), she smiled. One of the reasons people hate debates is because they find that the moderators donât do their jobs. They allow the candidates to walk all over them, they go over their allotted time, they interrupt each other. It gets annoying. Luckily, Trump was in stark contrast to Hillary Clinton. She listened to Holt when he told her that her time was up, and rarely interrupted Holt to attack Trump. While Trump interrupted Clinton 51 times, she interrupted Trump only 17 times. At the end, Clinton shook Holtâs hand, and Trump did not. While Trumpâs famous âCrooked Hillaryâ was front and center on Snapchat, the facts paint a different story. NPR, the non-partisan gold standard of whatâs left of journalism, did an in-depth fact check analysis and showed that, surprise, Trump lied way more than Clinton, while Clintonâs claims were mostly upheld as true. While Donald Trump painted America as third world, crime-riddled hellhole, Clinton offered us a hopeful, inspiring message of bringing back jobs, fixing broken race relations, and investigating in future generations. Her plan would create 10 million jobs â his would cut 3.5 million. She wants to curb gun violence against black youth by holding them and communities (yes, that includes police officers) accountable. Trump wants to implement the unconstitutional and ineffective Stop and Frisk. Surprisingly, the agreed on several issues, such as the No-Fly gun ban, opposition to the TPP, and a need to bring jobs back from overseas. But simply put, her way, not âTrumped up trickle down,â will get us there. This is why Clinton won. She was the stronger candidate, and she shined while everyone was hoping it would be the other way around.Â Trump devolved into his classic self as she increasingly got under his skin. No, it wasnât Holtâs fault. No, it wasnât the microphoneâs fault. No, it wasnât Hillaryâs fault. It was Trumpâs fault, plain and simple. Maybe heâll take preparation a little more seriously for next time. Or maybe not. it is Trump, after all. ",fake
"Most Americans don’t realize that all revolutions aren’t the result of overt force. Hitler, for instance, was voted into power in Germany, as was Hugo Chávez in Venezuela. Currently in the United States we are in the process of such a revolution by the progressive controlled Democrat party – sadly too many Americans are oblivious to what is happening. It is impossible to know for sure whether this revolution is being orchestrated by a SPECTRE-like secret cabal, or is the result of years of progressive fellow travelers advancing similar goals. In either case what has resulted is in essence a coup. America’s progressive revolution is being fought with ballots rather than bullets, and the progressives are winning. In order to do this the progressive movement had to overcome traditional American values or they would never be successful electing their way to power. Seriously, if the Democrat Party had run with its present polices 60 years ago they would have not have come close to winning a single state. So how have they managed to get to where they are today? In the ‘60’s progressives, then called liberals started taking over the liberal arts departments of our colleges and universities. Those humanity majors they converted to their ideology went into journalism, education, and the entertainment media. Whether it was by plan or by inclination most of these liberal college grads joined the Democrat party. Since Kennedy every single Democrat nominee for president has championed the progressive ideology. You could argue that Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton who were more opportunists than true believers, but that didn’t stop them from supporting progressive goals. Today you’d have a tough time finding even a moderate Democrat candidate. Heck, nearly half of the party was fine with nominating a self-described socialist. Along with a news and entertainment media protecting Democrats, and the education system promoting the progressive ideology you have former and current Democrats in government sponsoring policies that garner still more votes and thereby gain more power. Does anyone honestly believe that a picture ID is that difficult to come by? Democrats are all for anything legal, quasi-legal, and some would say even illegal to recruit more voters. Immigrants and refugees are welcomed, given entitlements and are set to be Democratic voters as soon as possible. We all remember the ACORN voter fraud scandal, but if anyone seriously thinks that that was an isolated incident should really think again. The progressive revolution is ongoing. There are around 300 so-called sanctuary cities in the United States. These progressive cities refuse to obey the law of the land and have gotten away with it. Likewise whole states refuse to follow federal laws when they don’t agree with them. Worse, our current president, and cabinet officers, and whole departments in the federal government ignore their oaths to defend the Constitution. And, thanks to the timid establishment Republicans have done so with impunity. When the Attorney General of the United States Eric Holder lied to Congress without consequences – other than being found in contempt of Congress – we have a coup going on. When the IRS can use its power to punish political enemies of the administration going so far as to destroy evidence, that is a revolution. And certainly when former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton broke the law but is protected by the State Department, and the Department of Justice refuses to indict, we have a collapse of the rule of law. That is what happens in a coup. Certainly President Obama acts as if he doesn’t have to follow the Constitution. For now many of his more overt executive orders have been blocked by the courts, but as the progressive revolution grows in strength the Democrats appoint more and more judges who view the Constitution as a living document. It is doubtful that the progressive revolution is led by Obama or his handlers; they just take advantage of the increasing progressive power in the country. President Obama has an arrogance about him that drives him to foreshadow events like the IRS investigation, Hillary Clinton’s email investigation, and a possible rigging of the 2016 election. [Read Related Article: Did Obama Just Foreshadow a RIGGED Election Come November?] When he was elected he did the same thing. In 2008 he said, “We are five days away from fundamentally transforming the United States of America.” That is what he’s done and progressive will continue to try to do. Hillary, if elected will continue the progressive coup, possibly beyond our power to reverse. A Trump victory, like Ronald Reagan’s, will slow it down, but it must take a sustained effort to confront our loss of freedom.

"Secretary of State John Kerry said at the Global Fishing Watch reception in D.C. that there is a small group of Americans who block every government action on global warming, because they think that once the ice caps melt – still waiting for that to happen – all that extra water will just “spill over the sides of a flat earth.”  Manmade global warming proponents are always comparing those who disagree with them to “flat-earthers.” The idea that there was a time when Christians and other “uneducated” people believed that the Earth was flat is a complete myth. That myth was promulgated largely by Darwinists in the latter part of the 19th century as a way to discredit Creationists. There wasn’t ever a time when the consensus among Christians was that the Earth was flat. This lie was perpetuated to show that Christians held to their “religious dogma” in spite of evidence discovered by “brave” and “objective” scientists who were persecuted by Christians for their discovery. So in reality, opponents of Columbus’s voyage didn’t actually say that they were concerned he might fall off the edge of the Earth. Their concern was mostly about how far he would be going in unknown territory and how much it would cost to finance such an expedition. What we do see throughout history is that the establishment of any particular field of study – whether it be science or medicine – is usually the group that holds fast to its theories in spite of new evidence and findings that might show the establishment to be in error. They hold on to their theories for political and financial reasons. They use their own clout to silence and/or ridicule those who threaten the status quo that they’ve created for themselves. And that’s just what the whole anthropogenic global warming myth is all about. They want to maintain their theories so they can benefit politically and financially from them. They can twist the scientific data to make it say whatever they want. And any scientist who tries to expose them for trying to cram inflated data inside a pre-formulated theory is ignored or discredited. We all know how an establishment treats whistleblowers.

"S Trump’s number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company’s hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA. Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment’s protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump’s campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that: According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. “The likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,” the lawsuit says. Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee’s most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel’s parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he’s supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether. Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan’s secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire’s then-secret sexual orientation. But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP’s bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, “Every American has a unique identity. I’m proud to be gay, I’m proud to be a Republican,” after a lengthy rant against “government incompetence.” He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period. Unfortunately, his own party didn’t pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s. “Federal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,” said the Department of Labor’s OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. “Our nation’s taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.” Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself “vigorously” and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News. Now, the executive who accused his employer – the federal government – of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company’s hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

"It definitely wouldn’t be all that surprising if George H.W. Bush is voting for Hillary Clinton. After all, his son Jeb didn’t do all that well during the primary campaign, and in a show of opposition to Donald Trump, no one in the Bush clan showed up at the Republican National Convention for Trump’s coronation. The Bushes themselves have remained mum on the subject of whom they’re voting for. In fact, they’ve pretty much stayed out of the presidential race altogether. But one insider says the elder Bush of 92 years will be casting his vote for the Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. That insider is one of the late Robert F. Kennedy’s daughters, Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend. She is a former Democratic lieutenant governor of Maryland. On Monday, she posted a picture of her shaking hands with Bill Clinton’s predecessor with the caption: “The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!”  According to Politico, Kennedy Townsend was visiting with the former President at his Maine summer home on Walker’s Point in Kennebunkport. Later in a phone interview with Politico, the Kennedy daughter confirmed, “That’s what he said.” But when pressed about it, a spokesman for Bush would neither confirm nor deny. In an email to Politico, Jim McGrath wrote, “The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.” Politico noted that George H.W. Bush wouldn’t be the first from his or his son’s administration to be voting for Hillary – or at least not voting for the Donald: “Many former GOP officials from both Bush administrations have also announced their support for Clinton over Trump, including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez.”    The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.",fake
"The Clinton campaign has slammed Donald Trump as “a fraud who believes the rules don’t apply to him” over reports that the GOP presidential candidate used money from his charitable foundation to settle two lawsuits filed against his for-profit businesses. The Washington Post reported today that Trump made two payments totaling $258,000 to settle suits — one involving the Mar-a-Lago Club, which he owns, in Florida and another involving one of his golf clubs in New York.  Clinton’s deputy communications director, Christina Reynolds, put out a statement after The Washington Post story was published, calling Trump a fraud. “Clearly the Trump Foundation is as much a charitable organization as Trump University is an institute of higher education,” she said. “Trump’s version of charity is taking money from others to settle his own legal issues ... which experts say is a clear violation of laws governing charitable organizations,” Reynolds said.   ABC News has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment.     Lloyd Mayer, a professor at the University of Notre Dame Law School, told ABC News that if the allegations made by the Post are true, the payments violate federal law.   “Federal tax law bars a private foundation like the Trump Foundation from using its assets to benefit its insiders or the businesses they own. That’s exactly what’s been alleged here. If true, the foundation and its managers, including Mr. Trump, violated tax laws,” Mayer told ABC News.  The lawsuit involving Mar-a-Lago, filed in 2007, revolved around a complaint by the town of Palm Beach over an oversize flagpole at the club. Publicly available court documents show that as a condition of a settlement, “Mr. Trump will contribute $100,000 to charities agreed to between the parties” in return for the town’s waiving fines against Mar-a-Lago. Another section of the court documents specified, “Mar-a-Lago shall contribute $100,000 to charities agreed to between parties dealing with Iraq War veterans, American flag or the local VA hospital.”   In a September 2007 letter to the town, as reported by the Post, Trump wrote, “I have sent a check for $100,000 to Fisher House. Although the court documents show that under the settlement, Trump or Mar-a-Lago would make the payment, the payment apparently instead came from the Trump Foundation. Tax forms for the Trump Foundation show that in 2007 the charity gave $100,000 to Fisher House, an organization that helps pay for housing for veterans’ relatives when their loved ones are receiving medical treatment. It was one of only three $100,000 donations it made that year; the other two were to a New York hospital and a police athletic league. Fisher House confirmed to ABC News that it received a $100,000 check from the foundation on Sept. 11, 2007. It does not have a copy of the check available.  The IRS has strict rules on the operation of tax-exempt private foundations, including against what it calls self-dealing. To qualify for tax-exempt status, a foundation is required to demonstrate, among other things, that “no part of its net earnings inure to the benefit of any private shareholder or individual,” according to an online IRS publication. Mayer noted that if the lawsuit settlement was paid for by Trump’s foundation, he wouldn’t be the first person to violate tax law in this way. “It’s not unheard of for people to use their private foundations for their own benefit. Usually if the IRS learns about it, the insider has to pay a penalty tax and repay foundation with interest,” Mayer said. It can be a civil action or a criminal violation, but Mayer has “never heard of anyone serving prison time for this kind of thing.” “Here the foundation allegedly paid for a substantial benefit to Trump’s business — the dropping of lawsuits. That is clearly crossing the line. It’s not even close,” he said.  The Trump Foundation takes in substantial donations from people and organizations, including until eight years ago Trump himself. In 2007, tax forms show that the charity had revenue of close to $4.1 million, from contributions, gifts and grants. Of that total, Trump donated $35,000. Similarly, in 2008, Trump gave $30,000 to the foundation. In previous years, his contributions were bigger, ranging from $184,000 to $713,000. Trump made no donations to his foundation from 2009 to 2014, which is the last year for which records are available. A few years after the Mar-a-Lago settlement, the foundation reportedly paid $158,000 to settle a lawsuit against one of Trump’s golf courses in New York, which led to a charitable donation by the foundation. The foundation is under investigation by the New York Attorney General’s Office over a payment made to a political group associated with Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, a Trump supporter who spoke at the Republican National Convention this summer. A person familiar with the probe tells ABC News that the New York Attorney General’s Office is also investigating all the donations mentioned in the Post report. The Clinton campaign’s Reynolds said in her statement, “Once again, Trump has proven himself a fraud who believes the rules don’t apply to him. It’s past time for him to release his tax returns to show whether his tax issues extend to his own personal finances.” ABC News’ Liz Kreutz contributed to this report.",true
"Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He’s surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he’s being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord. Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. “For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia” he tweeted in July. Now – brace yourself, this might come as a shock – it appears he’s been lying to us the whole time. An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has “numerous ties” to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. “The level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars — what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate—[and] be associated with Donald Trump” says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group. Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to “large numbers” of Russian buyers – so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as “Little Moscow.” The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion. The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense – they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth. “I think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption…They don’t read books. They don’t go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht” says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as “cultural ignoramuses…not interested in social justice.” Sound like anyone we know? When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow’s annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves – and Trump himself. “We’ll be looking at that, yeah we’ll be looking” said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July. These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it’s that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House. Watch ABC News’ report here: ",fake

"Washington (CNN)The Senate Wednesday rejected a bipartisan proposal to block a pending $1.15 billion United States arms sale to Saudi Arabia. Critics of the military deal, which was approved by the Obama administration last month, complained it could drag the US into the Saudi-led war in Yemen and contribute to the worsening humanitarian crisis there. The measure to disapprove the sale failed on a 26-71 vote. The outcome, which was a victory for Saudi Arabia, came as the US-Saudi relationship is being carefully examined and managed by restive lawmakers. Congress will vote in the coming days in favor of another highly sensitive matter the Saudis strongly oppose. Lawmakers are expected to override President Barack Obama's veto of a bill that would allow victims and families of the 9/11 terrorist strikes to sue Saudi Arabia for its alleged role in them. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Kentucky, aware of the potentially conflicting signals Congress is sending the Saudis, cited the importance of strong US-Saudi ties in explaining why he voted against the blocking the sale. ""I oppose that motion because I believe it would harm our nation's long term strategic interests in the Persian Gulf and the broader Middle East,"" he said. ""It would further damage our alliance and partnership with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at a time when our moderate Sunni Arab allies are questioning whether our nation is able to meet our traditional commitment to the region. The resolution would also ignore the shared interests we have with Saudi Arabia in combatting al Qaeda and ISIL."" A coalition of liberal and conservative senators pushed the resolution to scrap the sale. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, argued that by selling tanks and other military equipment to Saudi Arabia the US is essentially joining the war in Yemen without congressional authorization. ""We are complicit and actively involved with war in Yemen. There's been no debate in Congress, really no debate in the public sphere, over whether or not we should be at war in Yemen,"" Paul said. ""We are currently doing inflight refueling of bombers, Saudi Arabian bombers that are bombing in Yemen. We are helping to select sites and we actually have had Special Forces involved in these decisions in the theatre as well."" Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, warned America would be blamed for humanitarian disaster in Yemen and could lead to a backlash against the US. ""There have already been thousands and thousands of civilians killed,"" said Murphy. ""If you talk to Yemenis, they will tell you that this is perceived inside Yemen as not a Saudi-led bombing campaign, which it's broadly advertised in the newspapers, but as a US bombing campaign or at best a US-Saudi bombing campaign. There is a US imprint on every civilian death inside Yemen, which is radicalizing the people this country against the United States."" Senior GOP senators active in foreign policy matters -- such as Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker of Tennessee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona and Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, opposed blocking the sale. They argued that a strong Saudi Arabia provides a critical counterweight to the aspirations of Iran in the Middle East. ""The Middle East is a very complicated place,"" Graham said. ""But here's what's not complicated: Saudi Arabia shared intelligence with us that's made Americans safe. They have allowed us to use their air bases in time of conflict. They are all-in against ISIS and they are a great ally against the ambitions of the Iranians. To those who wish to sever the this relationship, be careful what you wish for."" ",true

"Donald Trump on Tuesday evening declared that the nation's African-American communities ""are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever."" As he has done regularly of late, Trump attacked the Democratic politicians who overwhelmingly control America’s urban centers as having failed the African-American populations who live there.

They’re worse, I mean honestly, places like Afghanistan are safer than some of our inner cities.” While Trump told the crowd that his message has been resonating with African-American voters, his poll numbers suggest otherwise. The Manhattan billionaire has struggled mightily with minority voters throughout his White House bid, polling often in the single digits among black voters and in some cases registering zero percent support.",true
"From the Daily Caller News Foundation: A total of 205 Clinton Foundation donors whose corporations and foundations collectively contributed $216 million since 2009, were awarded the most coveted invitations in the nation’s capital: prestigious seats at one or more White House State Dinners, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation investigation. At least 15 of the Clinton Foundation’s corporate donors — representing $47 million in contributions — were able to win invitations to two or more official state dinners. Significantly, the decision makers who authorized the special invitations were not at the White House at all, but were ensconced in the Department State’s Office of Protocol. The protocol office, chosen by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, are filled solely with long-time Clinton loyalists. Despite the Democratic presidential nominee’s departure from the Department of State in 2013, all of the top officeholders in the protocol office throughout Obama’s two terms have been senior staffers who served in either former President Bill Clinton’s White House or in Hillary’s Senate and 2008 presidential campaigns. Critics of the foundation worry Dennis Cheng — who served as Clinton’s protocol deputy chief and later went directly to the Clinton Foundation as its chief fundraiser — could have “walked away” with valuable donor lists compiled by the office. After Cheng left the Department of State, he raised a record quarter billion dollars while at the foundation. He is now Hillary’s national fundraiser, leading her presidential bid to raise $2 billion. As a result, The Daily Beast once called him, “Hillary Clinton’s $2 billion money man.” If Cheng shared confidential information with the foundation, he may have violated a special “Memorandum of Understanding” (MOU) signed by the foundation and the Obama transition team in November 2008. The MOU warned of avoiding “potential or actual conflict of interest.” Cheng also could run afoul of a 18 USC 208, a federal statute that “prohibits an executive branch employee from participating personally and substantially in a particular Government matter that will affect his own financial interests,” including those of a prospective employer or a family member. “How much of the mailing list and contact information Cheng got at Protocol, migrated over to the Clinton Foundation,” asked Charles Ortel a Wall Street investor and an outspoken critic of the Clinton Foundation. “We don’t yet how much of this extraordinarily valuable contact information as it walked out the front door either in Dennis Cheng’s personal cell phone, or on a contact list that might have been emailed.” he said in an interview with TheDCNF. Neither the foundation nor Hillary’s presidential campaign responded to inquiries about potential conflicts of interest surrounding Cheng. Bill boasted in a Tuesday CNN interview that foundation donors never benefited from any Department of State action, asserting, “to the best of my knowledge, nobody ever got anything from the State Department because they supported the Clinton Foundation.” Yet, official White House dinners are among the most glamorous and exclusive venues in Washington, D.C., and the competition to secure an invitation is fierce. Guests not only can mingle with a head of state and their closest advisors, but they also offer privileged access to the president, top White House staff and many cabinet members. Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova, who prosecuted corruption cases in Washington, D.C., told TheDCNF the White House dinners weren’t only benefits, but amounted to the “selling of access.” “The obvious connection between donations and access to big, White House state dinners is very important,” he said in an interview with TheDCNF.  “It was clearly a reward to donors, something they got as a result of giving money to the Clinton Foundation,” he stated. DiGenova was U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia and was appointed an Independent Counsel concerning the Clinton passport disclosure case. “We are looking into Cheng’s relationship between the State Department and the foundation and the political donor class,” former U.S. Attorney Matthew Whitaker told TheDCNF. Whitaker is the executive director of the ethics watchdog group, the Foundation for Accountability & Civic Trust (FACT). “Cheng is the person in the middle of this situation. He had substantial input as to who was invited, who got seated where,” he said. “I would say Cheng’s a key figure — really a shadowy figure — in this whole thing,” Whitaker added. “It’s very obvious to me that people were giving to the foundation, not only because they perceived they could get access to the State Department, but it now appears they were giving in order to get access to State Dinners at the White House,” he told TheDCNF. FACT has been trying to obtain the email traffic between Cheng and the Clinton Foundation under the Freedom of Information Act. The group initially filed an FOIA request in February 2015, but Department of State officials are refusing to release any of the emails before the presidential election. “They have been stonewalling us and not responsive and now they’re telling us that we probably won’t get it until mid-to-late November,” Whitaker said. He served as the US Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004-2009. The protocol office has been stacked from the very beginning with Clinton veterans. When Cheng served as deputy chief of the protocol office, his boss was Chief Capricia Marshall who, at age 32, served as the White House social secretary for Hillary when Bill was president. After Cheng left in 2011, his replacement was Natalie Jones, who was Hillary’s Mid-Atlantic finance director for her 2008 presidential bid. Jones was joined by Mark Walsh, Hillary’s LGBT “outreach director” from her 2008 campaign. Peter Selfridge succeeded Marshall in June 2014 as the chief of protocol and is the current head of the office. He served in the scheduling and advance office at former President Bill Clinton’s White House. One of the most revealing illustration of Cheng’s continuing contact with the the protocol office after he joined the Clinton Foundation is in email exchanges. In a March 8, 2012 email from Marshall to Jones, Cheng and Hillary’s deputy chief of staff, Huma Abedin, the chief happily identifies foundation donors who were to attend the March 14, 2012 state dinner for British Prime Minister David Cameron. “Invited to state dinner,” Marshall informed the group. Two of those invited included Clinton Democratic fundraiser Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who gave between $100,000 to $250,000, and Fred Eychaner, who committed $25 million to the foundation. “Nice,” replies Abedin. Although the 2008 MOU explicitly sought to build a wall between the foundation and Clinton’s official business, Cheng felt it was appropriate to later invite Abedin to a Clinton Foundation dinner that included foreign nationals. In a June 11, 2012 email, he urges Abedin to come to Little Rock for the dinner. “Attached is list of attendees for tomorrow night’s Clinton Foundation dinner,” he wrote Abedin. Among those attending was Recep Ozkan, a Turkish national who donated between $500,000 to $1 million to the Clinton Foundation. Ozkan was the liaison for Fethullah Gulen, a secretive Turkish cleric who allegedly was behind the failed July 15 coup attempt against the Turkish government of President Recep Erdogan. Erdogan filed papers with the U.S. government seeking the extradition of Gulen, according to Tuesday reports. Also attending the dinner was Victor Pinchuk, the Ukrainian tycoon who married the daughter of Ukrainian strongman Leonid Kuchma, who was considered a corrupt leader during his years in office. The email was obtained by Citizens United, a conservative group, under the Freedom of Information Act. One of the most notorious Clinton Foundation donors to attend a White House dinner was Rajat Gupta, a long-time personal friend of Bill’s who was convicted of insider trading. He served two years in a federal penitentiary. Gupta was the first foreign-born managing director at McKinsey & Company and reportedly hired Chelsea Clinton for her first job. Without any experience, he paid her a six figure salary. Gupta attended the dinner for the Indian Prime Minister in 2009. Ortel claims the pattern of awarding government perks to donors began in the 1990s during Bill’s first term at the White House.  At the time, Clinton and his aides rented out the Lincoln Bedroom to 66 campaign contributors and offered seats on Air Force One to 56 contributors. “To see the pattern, you really have to go back to when they were in control of the White House, the first time and they clearly demonstrated the propensity to rent out the Lincoln bedroom, to sell seats on Air Force One,” Ortel told TheDCNF. “So this was an old game.” Rep. Marsha Blackburn, the Tennessee Republican congresswoman who is vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee and leading a congressional investigation into the Clinton Foundation, told TheDCNF, “This is further evidence of the Clinton’s ‘Pay to Play’ mentality. The State Dinners provide incredible opportunities to meet our government’s highest ranking officials and Clinton Foundation donors were able to get special access simply because they stroked a check.” “The quid pro quo is astonishing and it begs the question of whether the Clintons are beneath selling anything,” Blackburn charged. Lloyd Blankfein, Goldman Sachs’ chairman and CEO, attended one of the hottest state dinners — a January 19, 2011 White House State Dinner for former Chinese President Hu Jintao. His company donated $1 to $5 million to the foundation, and its Goldman Philanthropy Fund gave an additional $250,000 to $500,000, according to the Clinton Foundation website. But that wasn’t the only contributions to Bill and Hillary. The company also gave the couple $2.25 million for 12 speeches before Goldman Sachs venues. Brian Moynihan, Bank of America’s CEO and chairman, attended the May 19, 2010 state dinner toasting Felipe Calderon, Mexico’s former president. The Bank of America Foundation donated between $500,000 to $1 million to the Clinton Foundation, and the Bank of America Corporation contributed between $100,000 to $250,000. But Bank of America also paid more than $1 million for four speeches to both Bill and Hillary. The Clinton Foundation donors invited to more than one state dinner were: Honeywell, GE, Dreamworks, PepsiCo, Morgan Stanley, Coca Cola, Dow, Boeing, Intel, UPS, Comcast, IBM and the Blackstone Group. Microsoft and the Ford Foundation were invited to three state dinners. J.T. Mastranadi, political director of the Citizens United, said his organization’s conclusion was, “regardless of where you happened to be employed at any given time – the Clinton State Department or the Clinton Foundation – the top priority was always donor maintenance.” TheDCNF contacted the Clinton Foundation and Hillary’s presidential campaign about a wide range of questions regarding the state dinners and the foundation. Neither responded. To see the full list of Clinton Foundation Donor attendees to all 12 White House State Dinners, click here.

"You can choose one or more of the explanations for what has happened to Hillary Clinton in recent weeks as Donald Trump has closed in on her in the polls. The “fundamentals” of this year—economic and political data—have pointed to a close race for more than a year; Trump has (until his recent birther nonsense) offered a more temperate version of himself; Clinton has been haunted by her emails and her health; Republican holdouts have been returning to the fold, another sign that the electorate will vote more and more along lines of party preference. But what is especially bedeviling the Clinton campaign is that, at least until now, constituencies most critical to her campaign seem to have no sense of urgency about keeping the Donald Trump out of the White House. While Hispanics, who backed Obama in 2012 by a more than 2-1 margin, support Clinton by a similar margin, they seem far less inclined to vote than they did four years ago. Story Continued Below That is what could change now that Trump threatens to actually take the White House. Younger voters, who not only backed Obama by landslide margins but turned out in record percentages in 2012, have until now expressed relative indifference to the campaign or have turned to the alternatives: Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein. If last week’s Quinnipiac poll is right, the race among 18-to-34-year-olds looks like a four-way split: She wins only 31 percent to Trump’s 26 percent. In fact, Johnson runs second, with 29 percent; Stein, running in low single digits nationally, pulls in 15 percent of 18-to-34 year olds. And remember: without massive support and a heavy turnout among younger voters, Obama’s margins in Florida and other key states would have been wiped out. Yes, support for minor party candidates tend to fall when the leaves do; yes, the Clinton campaign has a get-out-the-vote machine whose reputation—yet untested—is formidable. But what may be their most powerful weapon is the clear possibility that Trump could win, which is why Clinton’s very bad few weeks could, in the end, be very good for her. Trump’s climbing numbers could finally motivate her complacent Democratic base and other voters who have never been crazy about her and not especially motivated to come out to the polls, especially if she were running away with the race. Here is where Hillary Clinton might think about channeling the arguments of two historical figures you might not normally think of in the same paragraph: Oliver Cromwell and John McEnroe. Back in 1650, the first (and last) non-royal ruler of Britain tried to dissuade the Scots from declaring Charles II as king. Saying, in a famous appeal: “I beseech you, in the bowels of Christ, consider it possible that you may be mistaken.” Three hundred and eighty one years later, in the midst of another British field of battle—Wimbledon—John McEnroe saw one of his serves ruled a fault and screamed incredulously: “You cannot be serious!” Somewhere between Cromwell and McEnroe lies the Clinton campaign’s most plausible argument to its wavering voters: Get real, folks. “You’re looking at Johnson and Stein as a way of rejecting a corrupt, unresponsive two-party system,” England’s Lord Protector might say to millennials, sounding a lot like Bernie Sanders, “because there’s no difference between the two parties. But please be willing to consider that you might be mistaken. Look back 16 years, and see what a similar vote—for Ralph Nader—did. His 94,000 voters in Florida would have wound up giving Gore a net of about 20,000 votes—more than enough to make butterfly ballots and hanging chads irrelevant. Now, between launching the Iraq War and the two Supreme Court justices Bush appointed, did it really make no difference?” McEnroe—looking and sounding remarkably like Elizabeth Warren, who’s now out there stumping for Hillary—might then chime in: “You cannot be serious if you think you have the luxury of a ‘protest’ vote for Johnson or Stein. If you vote as a Libertarian for Johnson, you will materially increase the chances of a Trump presidency. Look at the list of potential judges. On everything from gay rights to abortion to his own views of the First Amendment, Trump is on record as rejecting core libertarian principles. If you vote for Jill Stein as a progressive, you are helping to put in power a president whose tax plan makes the rich richer, who thinks climate chance is a hoax, who wants to abolish whole swaths of environmental protection laws. So voting for Johnson or Stein means you’re voting for a label—a ’libertarian,’ or a ‘progressive’—without realizing that the consequence of that vote could lead to a president who rejects everything you claim to hold dear.” There’s no guarantee that any of these arguments will work. They come, after all, at the end of a 15-month-long Trump campaign that was guaranteed to collapse at countless moments (I’d list them, but anyone following this campaign has likely committed them to memory). And it still requires, as its ultimate point, an insistence that these voters summon themselves to vote for a candidate for whom they have little or no enthusiasm. Obama’s supporters turned out in significant numbers because they were hungry and saw in his presidency a feast; the voters Clinton must summon are being told “eat your peas because you have to.” That’s an emotional detachment that a dozen speeches heavy on policy, like the one she delivered Monday, won’t repair. Of course, it’s possible that Trump’s own character and temperament, revealed on the debate stage or in his bizarre-world campaign appearances, will convince voters that in the end , he is a risk they are not prepared to take. But for voters unsure about Clinton, relying on Trump to self-destruct after what he has survived is a risk they cannot take. So, even though the Scottish Presbyterians rejected Cromwell’s plea, and even though the officials at Wimbledon did not change their call, their pleas still suggest that Trump’s rise in the polls could be a powerful argument for Clinton.",true
"Mike Pence defended his running mate Donald Trump’s call for nationwide stop-and-frisk policies that they claim have been effective in preventing crime despite concerns it could exacerbate ties with minority communities. “It’s on a sound constitutional footing,” Pence said on ""Fox News Sunday,"" after acknowledging that one federal court struck down the practice after statistics revealed it targeted overwhelming numbers of African-American and Hispanic residents in New York. Story Continued Below The Indiana governor, describing an “avalanche of violence” wracking Chicago, said the policy gives police authority to search those “they think may be involved or about to be involved in criminal activity.” Pence sidestepped a question about Trump’s claim that lax vetting of immigrants somehow contributed to last weekend’s terrorist attacks in Minnesota, New York and New Jersey. The attackers implicated in those incidents were both admitted to the United States as children. Pence didn’t say how tougher vetting would have helped prevent those attacks, but he said: “We need common sense back in our immigration policies.” Pence also referenced a Turkish immigrant implicated in a Friday shooting north of Seattle that left five dead as he made his call for changes in immigration policy. “We don’t know the motivation of the permanent legal resident in Washington state who took five American lives last night,” he said.",true
"Animal lovers, get your tissues ready, because you are about to bawl your eyes out, especially if you are a dog lover.  You know what? Don’t even read further if you are part of the man’s best friend club, you just might regret your decision to get out of bed this morning. News just hit the web that the locally famous three year-old dog named Loung, who fell out of a truck last year, landing on a busy route between Cambodia and Thailand, has been hit and killed by a car as it waited for the return of its owner for over a year. You can start the waterworks as we go into the details. The Sukhumvit Road, or Thailand Route 3, is a leading highway between Bangkok and Cambodia and Loung’s owner must not have realized that she had fallen right out of the truck. What’s truly amazing is that the dog refused to leave the area, hoping that one day her owner would return and rescue her.  Local people in the village of Ban Nong Khon in Chanthaburi province took the responsibility of feeding her as she waited for her owner. After some time had passed, Loung became somewhat of a celebrity for the locals and tourists, with many people stopping by weekly to take a photo with the lone dog. Many people would occasionally stop by the highway, claiming to be Loung’s true owners, but would be met with timidness and distrust, she would run off into the jungle as soon as someone tried to leash her up to take her.   Loung unfortunately met her end last week, with many photos of the dead and bloodied dog being released in the newspaper. That distasteful act caused so much outrage from many locals and social media users that the media companies took the photos down. The story has been going viral ever since. A dog lover’s club in Thailand has donated money for the funeral expenses of Loung…hoping to give a proper burial for such a loyal animal. ",true

"It only took Seth Meyers ten minutes to blow up the gullible media for broadcasting an hour-long Trump infomercial, willfully spreading more of the Republican nominee’s outrageous lies and allowing him to twist the narrative and pretend that he hasn’t been leading the birther movement for the past five years while using the occasion to promote his new hotel. After a half an hour of free advertising, Trump finally tossed the media the bone they were waiting for, a thirty second statement with no apology that FALSELY claimed that Hillary Clinton started the birther movement in the first place. You don’t peddle racist rhetoric for five years and then decide when it’s over. We decide when it’s over. And it’s certainly not over after a thirty second statement in a thirty minute hotel commercial. He’s right. Donald Trump is a shameless birther, a man who spent half a decade making racist claims about President Obama long past any rational point of interest, questioning the President’s birthplace and religion for the sake of personal attention within the bigot wing of the Republican Party. Anyone naïve enough to believe that Donald Trump isn’t a hate-mongering politician merely must look at that thirty second statement, which was immediately followed by the a concentrated effort by the Trump campaign to gaslight the country and claim innocence while blaming Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. “I’m not sure the guy who holds fake press conferences, has a fake university, a fake foundation, fake hair, and a fake tan, should be in charge of deciding what’s real!” rips Meyers. But it’s a crock of lies, and Seth Meyers called out the Republican nominee for knowingly pulling the hotel commercial stunt which Trump admitted in a tweet. Meyers pointed out that even CNN’s anchors thought Donald Trump was full of crap while their infomercial was rolling, but they didn’t cut or break away and kept letting the Republican candidate hawk his hotel anyway. Meyers then rips into Trump surrogate and disgraced New Jersey governor Chris Christie for defending Trump while prosecutors are accusing him of orchestrating the “Bridgegate scandal.”The traditional “objective” style of coverage with it’s he said-she said equivalence is not capable of aptly conveying the factual reality of the gushing sewer of falsehoods that is Donald Trump. We who write here seek to ably analyze the news from a reasonable person’s point of view and present to you our readers what has actually occurred with a transparent written analysis of events based on the solid and established facts at hand in our detailed stories. It’s about time that the media quit giving a free pass to Trump and his lying pack of surrogates, scoundrels and birthers. If they remind the entire country daily that the Republican nominee is a racist birther for at least 30 seconds of each political news program daily, maybe it would help make up for the three billion dollars in free advertising they’ve already gifted to his vile campaign of hatred.

"During the violent protests in Charlotte, NC, a protester shot into the crowd there. He wound up shooting Justin Carr in the head. At first the media reported he had died… Justin did not die until last night – he was on life support. This morning, the police apprehended the man they think killed him… Rayquan Borum. There are those saying the police killed Justin with rubber bullets. I don’t believe that at all. Surveillance video shows Borum shooting the gun that killed Justin. Lay blame where blame is due. The shooting happened the second night of the protests in Charlotte. It was an awful, bloody scene. I don’t know why anyone would just fire into the crowd like that. It makes no sense. Someone was bound to be hit and die. Maybe the guy just didn’t care. A white man was also kicked and beaten brutally in a garage by the protesters there. So much violence over a justified shooting by a black police officer. It’s as if facts don’t matter… they just want revolution in the streets.  From The Federalist Papers Project: The several nights of chaos in Charlotte, North Carolina led to the death of a man who was present at the protests; his name was Justin Carr. He was shot on Wednesday night and and died Thursday morning. Amid the chaos, it was difficult to tell exactly what happened. All we have known up until this point was that one of the protesters fired on Carr and that his injuries led to his death. However, there are new developments out of Charlotte. Fox News has more: Rayquan Borum, 21, was charged Friday morning in shooting death of Justin Carr, who died a day after being shot during protests in Trade Street, Charlotte-Mecklenberg Police Chief Kerr Putney said. Putney said surveillance footage supplied by buildings in the area helped identify the suspect. The shooting occurred Wednesday night, and Charlotte police initially said the man had died, although he survived on life support until Thursday. Witnesses gave conflicting accounts about who shot him, with some insisting they saw police gun him down with rubber bullets, while others said he was killed by a fellow protester.  Who will protest for Justin Carr? Certainly not Black Lives Matter. To them, he is a war casualty. They’ll just step over his body and riot on. There will be no marches or demands for justice for Justin. These people use others and then discard their dead bodies as they go. It’s the communist, radical way. They are now trying to lay the blame for Justin Carr’s death on the police. I don’t believe it and won’t until I see video proving it. It is far more likely it is the guy that has been arrested. My only question is did someone pay him to shoot things up?

"Assistant Attorney General John Carlin, the longest-serving head of the Justice Department's National Security Division who has overseen a flurry of high-profile terrorism and cyber espionage cases, will step down next month, officials said. Mary McCord is set to replace him as acting assistant attorney general on Oct. 15. Story Continued Below Carlin, 43, joined the National Security Division in 2009, only three years after it was established to consolidate the Justice Department's national security and intelligence functions, and was confirmed as head in 2014. He has overseen a robust increase in prosecutions for domestic terrorism, including the Boston Marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, and steered the first conviction for attempting to construct a radiological device with the prosecution last year of Glendon Scott Crawford, a member of the Ku Klux Klan found guilty of planning to target unsuspecting Muslim-Americans with lethal doses of radiation. Attorney General Loretta Lynch praised his pioneering role. ""He oversaw the unprecedented indictment of five members of the Chinese military for cyber-enabled economic espionage and the investigation of the attack on Sony Pictures Entertainment’s computer systems,"" she said in a statement. ""And he forged crucial collaborations with our partners in the intelligence community, law enforcement and the private sector, enhancing our collective ability to detect and deter threats as they arise.” Since 2013, 110 individuals nationwide have been charged as foreign fighters for global terrorist groups, for engaging in violent extremism in the U.S. or for providing material support to the Islamic State, according to the Justice Department. “John Carlin is a dedicated public servant committed to upholding the rule of law, pursuing justice and keeping Americans safe,"" Lisa Monaco, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, said in a statement. ""Throughout his distinguished career — most recently as assistant attorney general for national security — John has worked, largely behind the scenes, to do exactly that."" Carlin's division played an instrumental role earlier this year in several international computer hacking cases. Su Bin, a Chinese national, was sentenced to 46 months after pleading guilty to working with Chinese military officers to steal military technical data from U.S. defense contractors. Seven Iranian hackers were also indicted for working on behalf of private companies connected with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to deny service to the U.S. financial sector. One of the defendants was also indicted for compromising the industrial control system of the Bowman Dam in Rye, N.Y. Carlin previously served as the chief of staff to then-FBI Director Robert Mueller and was a federal prosecutor, serving as the national coordinator of the Justice Department’s Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property Program and as an assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia. A Justice Department official said Carlin was not prepared to discuss his future plans, but predicted he'd be a big draw for the private sector.",true
"Barack Hussein Obama Soetoro Sobarkah’s Muslim convert CIA Director John Brennan has admitted to giving his support to the Communist Party in the 1976 election. Last week, during the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation’s annual conference, Brennan admitted that he was asked if he had “ever worked with or for a group that was dedicated to overthrowing the US” during his first polygraph test to enter the Central Intelligence Agency. “I froze,” Brennan said. “This was back in 1980, and I thought back to a previous election where I voted, and I voted for the Communist Party candidate.” Claiming that he believed the Constitution protected free speech, he said he decided to answer truthfully. “We’ve all had indiscretions in our past,” he said. “I would not be up here if that was disqualifying.” “I froze, because I was getting so close to coming into CIA and said, ‘OK, here’s the choice, John. You can deny that, and the machine is probably going to go, you know, wacko, or I can acknowledge it and see what happens,'” Brennan said. The question Brennan was asked came from the 1940 Smith Act, which “prohibit[ed] certain subversive activities,” among those were overthrow of the US Government by force or violence. Thus the question that is routinely asked is, “Have you EVER advocated (either directly or indirectly) the overthrow of any government by force or violence?” “I said I was neither Democratic nor Republican, but it was my way, as I was going to college, of signaling my unhappiness with the system, and the need for change,” Bennan added. “I said I’m not a member of the Communist Party, so the polygrapher looked at me and said, ‘OK,’ and when I was finished with the polygraph and I left and said, ‘Well, I’m screwed.'” Brennan then attempted to put the people to sleep regarding their freedoms by stating, “So if back in 1980, John Brennan was allowed to say, ‘I voted for the Communist Party with Gus Hall’ … and still got through, rest assured that your rights and your expressions and your freedom of speech as Americans is something that’s not going to be disqualifying of you as you pursue a career in government.” It’s interesting that Mr. Brennan would make such a statement considering the CIA suspended an employee who refused to sign a non-disclosure agreement on Benghazi, wanted to allow Benghazi survivors to talk to Congress, but kept it classified, is known as a bully, and has continued to help aid America’s enemies in the Middle East. We could even point to the fact that man would not even be sworn in on a Bible, but rather a copy of the Constitution without the Bill of Rights and that was only after he had the largest number of votes against his confirmation in our history. Between 1950 and 1957, many Communist Party members were indicted and convicted for advocating Communism. According to Wikipedia: After a ten-month trial at the Foley Square Courthouse in Manhattan, eleven leaders of the Communist Party were convicted under the Smith Act in 1949.[50] Ten defendants received sentences of five years and $10,000 fines. An eleventh defendant, Robert G. Thompson, a distinguished hero of the Second World War, was sentenced to three years in consideration of his military record. The five defense attorneys were cited for contempt of court and given prison sentences. Those convicted appealed the verdicts, and the Supreme Court upheld their convictions in 1951 in Dennis v. United States in a 6-2 decision. Following that decision, the DOJ prosecuted dozens of cases. In total, by May 1956, another 131 communists were indicted, of whom 98 were convicted, nine acquitted, while juries brought no verdict in the other cases.[51] Other party leaders indicted included Claudia Jones and Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, a founding member of the ACLU. However, June 17, 1957, Yates v. United States held unconstitutional the convictions of numerous party leaders in a ruling that “distinguished between advocacy of an idea for incitement and the teaching of an idea as a concept.” However, consider that that new Cold War, which has always been going on despite what the media has presented to us, is brewing and should anyone be surprised the Brennan, Obama and other Communist/Islamist ideologists are in positions of power?

"Barack Obama is planning on leaving office the same way he came in, making things all about him.  Speaking to a Congressional Black Caucus event on Saturday Night, the narcissist-in-chief said he would take it as a personal insult if Black voters didn’t turn out and vote for Hillary Clinton. I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good send-off, go vote. (…) Obama also sought to blunt Trump’s recent efforts to reach out to black voters, saying Trump at one point in the race had said there’s never been a worse time to be a black person. “I mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery and Jim Crow, but we’ve got a museum for him to visit,” Obama said, a reference to next week’s opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture. “We will educate him.” Obama may have been referring to an ABC interview with Trump in 2015 when he asserted the nation’s first black president had done “nothing” for African-Americans. “They are worse now than just about ever,” he said. While it is not the worst time ever for African Americans, it’s been pretty bad.  The chart below uses Census Bureau data to show what has happened to household income African American and all U.S. households under Obama.

"It’s no coincidence Donald Trump rolled out his child care proposal this week in suburban Philadelphia, with his daughter Ivanka by his side. To win Pennsylvania, the GOP nominee must remain competitive in the populous suburbs that ring the state’s largest city. Recent polls suggest he’s not even close. Story Continued Below And unless Trump can boost his performance on the outskirts of cities like Philadelphia, Milwaukee, Detroit and Columbus, Ohio — particularly in the more affluent suburbs where middle-class women and college-educated white voters have eyed him askance — he risks being overwhelmed by the large Democratic margins delivered by the nearby big cities. “He’s played the white, working-class speech,” said Terry Madonna, a veteran Pennsylvania pollster, referring to the message Trump has aimed at working class white men in economically struggling communities. “He’s not really made an appeal to [suburban] individuals.” The suburbs, where 47 percent of all votes were cast in 2012, went narrowly for Romney after voting narrowly for Barack Obama in 2008. This time around, with Trump doing little to tailor his message beyond his base of disaffected white men, he’s lagging far behind Romney’s performance. A Franklin and Marshall College poll in late August showed Hillary Clinton with a 45-31 advantage in the Philadelphia suburbs. An analysis from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel revealed drastic underperformance by Trump in suburban Milwaukee’s Waukesha County, a conservative bastion where GOP candidates typically run up huge margins. While Trump led Clinton by 45 percent to 32 percent over the summer, he was far behind Romney’s pace there — the 2012 GOP nominee carried Waukesha by 67 percent to 32 percent. The story is similar in Virginia, another swing state. According to an August Washington Post poll, Trump was running well behind Romney’s clip in the close-in D.C. suburbs and also in the Northern Virginia exurbs — places like Loudoun County, a critical battleground that Obama won by 5 points in 2012. “I think it's more a matter of tone than it is his platform,” said Val DiGiorgio, chairman of the Republican Party of Chester County, the only one of Philadelphia’s four main suburban counties that Romney won in 2012. “We're a county where fiscal conservatives tend to do very well. If he could convince these folks that he's a fiscal conservative and acts more presidential, he could win over some of these voters. They dislike Hillary so intensely.” GOP leaders and pollsters say Trump can’t win without making inroads in the suburbs — and voters there are turned off by his bluster and sometimes-erratic nature. But many also say Clinton’s unpopularity is keeping Trump in the hunt. “There are some voters out there, they would prefer not to vote for Clinton, but they have yet to see Trump as a viable alternative,” added John Brabender, a GOP strategist who helped steer Rick Santorum to a Senate victory in Pennsylvania. “Trump can still take advantage of it. Trump needs to show a comfort level from a personality and temper standpoint.” Trump’s temperament has been a persistent issue throughout the campaign — nowhere more than in the suburbs — but there are signs an image makeover is underway. Aside from his uneven attempts to moderate some positions, eschew some of his harsher rhetoric and hew more closely to a script with the use of a TelePrompter, the campaign has been dispatching his children and their spouses to the critical suburban counties that could decide his fate. On Sept. 11, Trump’s daughter-in-law Lara made an unannounced stop in Painesville, Ohio — in suburban Cleveland’s Lake County — for a 9/11 memorial event. She’s also been active in her native North Carolina, where she reportedly helped open a field office in the Charlotte suburbs. She’s also joining Trump’s other women surrogates to help soften his image in these key communities. Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, stood alongside her father to unveil Trump’s new child care plan in Delaware County, a Democratic-leaning suburb of Philadelphia,. She’s also arranging a trip to Colorado next week — after a Saturday visit to the Denver suburbs by her father — for a series of events. Last week, Donald Trump Jr. was also in Colorado too for events in downtown Denver — one with millennials, one with sportsmen — before heading north for a fundraiser in Windsor. The campaign is also in talks to send one of the Trump kids next month to Chester County, another crucial suburb outside Philadelphia, when the local GOP holds its fall reception. Trump supporters view the candidate's children as highly effective surrogates who can smooth some of the mogul’s rougher edges and articulate (or talk around) some of Trump’s harsher policies and rhetoric, the central challenge Trump has faced to making inroads in the suburbs. “The important thing is that you’re sending people that connect with people in the community,” said Robert Blaha, Trump’s Colorado campaign chairman. “Ivanka coming and talking to young millennial women -- like the role she played last night on the stage — the more you can connect with those groups, the more people can understand the candidate.” The suburbs, of course, aren’t a monolithic voting bloc. While Trump’s struggles appear most acute in the affluent suburbs and among minorities in more mature suburbs, he’s actually well-positioned to make gains in some of the more industrial suburbs, which are prevalent in Ohio. “A lot of suburbs have mini Rust Belts within them, and the same sort of angry, white working class voters have found Trump appealing,” said Larry Levy, executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University. “When you add it all up, the give and the take, Trump is almost certainly going to do worse than prior Republicans. A big tiebreaker is the number of new immigrants and other minorities, are the fastest growing population bloc in many suburbs.” In Ohio, Levy noted, the Cleveland suburbs are riper targets for Trump because of their industrial tilt, while the Columbus suburbs are full of those more affluent white voters that haven’t warmed to Trump. Suburban Republican leaders say that even in places where Trump may be lagging behind Romney’s performance, they see some recent evidence his fortunes may be improving. “Our polling indicates he's down among the more affluent, suburban part of the county,” DiGiorgio, the Chester County chairman, said. “I'd say he's rebounded since then. He's probably still losing Chester County.” Dale Fellows, chairman of the Cleveland-area Lake County GOP, said he’s seen an uptick in support for Trump among women. He noted the recent visit by Lara Trump, who was accompanied by Trump surrogates Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, the YouTube personalities who go by the names Diamond and Silk. “Republican women are starting to become more engaged,” he said. “That’s, I think, going to make a big difference in the outcome of the election.” In Virginia’s Loudoun County, outside of Washington D.C., Trump is still working to put his base together. “I’ll be honest, that’s something that’s still happening,” said Will Estrada, chairman of the county GOP. But he points to what he views as some optimistic signs — from a mad rush to claim Trump lawn signs to a decision by longtime Trump hater and prominent conservative radio host Mark Levin, a resident of the county in Leesburg, to relent and announce his support for Trump. “Every day that gets closer to Election Day, we’re seeing the base come on board with Donald Trump,” he said.",true
"On Monday, Donald Trump fulfilled his duty as a presidential candidate by praising law enforcement for catching Ahmad Khan Rahami, who was responsible for the Saturday bombing in New York City. Twitter This would have normally been a nice gesture, if it hadnât been a contradiction of something Trump had said just a few minutes before. Fortunately, whenever Trump flip-flops or lies, Americans are able to instantly respond and call him out on his bullsh*t via social media â and they didnât hesitate to remind Trump that just a few minutes before he congratulated law enforcement for Rahamiâs capture, heâd dissed the NYPD for allowing âpolitical correctnessâ to interfere with catching terrorists. Among the first to point this out was MSNBCâs Christopher Hayes, who tweeted: Â  Twitter Â  Hayes was referring to a disrespectful comment Trump had made on Â shortly before he congratulated the police officers, in which he said: âYou know, our police are amazing, our local police. They know who a lot of these people are, they are afraid to do anything about it, because they donât want to be accused of profiling, and they donât want to be accused of all sorts of things.â Yup â Trump had accused the NYPD of being cowards and knowing who terrorists are, yet he has the nerve to congratulate them in almost the same time frame. Other people recognized this epic fail as well, and blasted the Republican nominee for being so untrustworthy and two-faced: Twitter Twitter Twitter Twitter This tweet was particularly funny, and Iâm sure there will be some backlash for Trump to deal with: Twitter Throughout his presidential campaign, Trump has defended law enforcement far more fiercely than African American police brutality victims to help paint the picture that he is a âlaw and orderâ candidate. But thanks to his asinine comments about law enforcementÂ having blood on their hands by assisting terrorists, Trump has probably just ruined a year of pro-law enforcement campaigning. ",true
"The stated reason the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department didn’t release their body cam and dash cam footage of the shooting was that by doing so, it might interfere with the investigation. Amid calls from the public and Keith Scott’s family to release the footage of the shooting, the police have now decided to comply with those demands. Police chief Kerr Putney had been saying that the video footage didn’t show conclusive evidence that Scott was holding a gun. Neither footage from the dash cam and one of the officers body cams showed it, and the officer who fatally shot Scott – Brentley Vinson, a black man – wasn’t wearing a body camera. GRAPHIC VIDEO: part of the dash-cam video released by @CMPD #KeithScott @TWCNewsCLT pic.twitter.com/fGAYdQpiAs — Christina Watkins (@CWatkinsTV) September 24, 2016   So, the footage has now been released, but it doesn’t make the incident any clearer. Scott is seen very briefly and from no angles that show whether or not he was holding a weapon. What is seen in the video, however, is Scott inching backwards right before he got shot. He didn’t appear to be pointing anything at anyone. So, if he had a gun in his hand, he wasn’t aiming at any of the cops. Marijuana joint Was it necessary for the police to shoot Scott? It’s hard to say at this point, since all we have are bits and pieces, and the police report. According to an eyewitness account, Scott didn’t have anything in his hand, and he was reading a book. That we know probably wasn’t the case, since the police didn’t recover a book from the scene. And they did recover a handgun and an ankle holster. And a marijuana joint. Probably not a book. I’m usually torn with these kinds of shootings. On one hand, I understand that police are on edge when a civilian has a gun. But too often – not necessarily in this case – police overreact and shoot when there really wasn’t a threat. When police do overreact, I don’t think it’s evidence of “racism.” I think it’s evidence that our society is on edge. Civilians are afraid that the police will abuse their authority, and the police are afraid that civilians will shoot at them. Both sides have issues that need to be resolved, and until that happens, officer-involved shootings will continue.

"President Barack Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are holding what is expected to be their final meeting as heads of government on Wednesday—and there is every reason to expect that this one in New York, at the United Nations General Assembly, will be as fruitless as previous encounters. It is no secret that U.S.-Israel relations have become volatile and tense over the past eight years, with Obama and Netanyahu sparring over Israeli settlements and the all-but-moribund peace process, Iran’s nuclear program, and the uprisings of the Arab Spring. But the likelihood of a sputtering end to the Barack-and-Bibi relationship does lead one to ask: Which of the two candidates who are running to replace Obama next January—Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump—might do somewhat better in restoring the U.S.-Israel relationship and pushing for peace? Story Continued Below Trump surrogate and former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani claimed at the Republican convention that Netanyahu and other government ministers favored Trump. Our sources say the Israeli security cabinet is divided but on the whole views Clinton as the safer course. There is, in any event, no doubt that the governing Likud Party has become closely aligned with Republicans in recent years, and that Netanyahu was betting on a Mitt Romney victory four years ago. “The notion that they don’t intervene in our politics and we don’t intervene in theirs is pure nonsense,” as Aaron David Miller, a Middle East negotiator for successive U.S. administrations, has put it. “Netanyahu has clearly made his preferences clear on the Republican side.” But Netanyahu is himself often second-guessed by Israel’s national security elites. And the answer to the question of who really would be better for a future U.S.-Israel alliance, a President Clinton or a President Trump, requires starting with a more basic issue: What does it mean to be a good ally to Israel? The current Israeli government seems to think that a good American ally would stop nagging Jerusalem about West Bank settlements, forget about the Israel-Palestine peace process, provide a blank check for security assistance, use military force in the region more readily, tear up the nuclear deal with Iran, and also supply weapons for Israel to strike Iran unilaterally if it thought it was necessary at some point. Hillary Clinton certainly would not follow this agenda to the letter; in that sense, her administration might well share some of Obama’s priorities. She clearly values the U.S.-Israel alliance highly, she is committed to Israel’s security, and she has credibly promised to fend off diplomatic efforts that Israelis see as “delegitimizing” the Jewish state whether at the U.N., through sanctions, boycotts or punitive disinvestment. At the same time, she has confirmed that the peace process and a two-state solution will be central to her Israel policies. And she promises to safeguard, not tear up, the nuclear deal with Iran. Safeguarding means holding Iran to its terms and being prepared, as Obama promised in spring 2012, to use military force if needed to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. Many Israelis derided Obama’s commitment—wrongly, in our view. But Clinton’s credibility regarding the use of force should not be in doubt. On balance, we think, she would be a better president in the long run for Israel. Here’s why. If Jerusalem hopes for an American president to renege on the nuclear deal, Trump may well be their man. He has certainly bragged about his history of walking away from agreements. What happens then, however, is a question for which Trump has no convincing answer. Some of his advisers point to Richard Nixon’s “madman” theory of how to frighten rivals with the unpredictability of American leadership. But Nixon, whatever his other faults, was a shrewd geo-strategist (and he had Henry Kissinger by his side). Trump, judging by his erratic and impulsive behavior on just about any given day of this campaign, seems far too close to the madman template for anyone’s comfort—least of all a small Middle Eastern state that depends on a steadiness of commitment from its American protector. Steadiness is one of the last words that come to mind when thinking about Trump’s various statements about Israel and the Palestinians. He could embrace something resembling neutrality and demand a return on U.S. assistance—signature Trump foreign policy themes—or, alternatively, as he put it, he could be ""the most pro-Israel president ever.” This uncertainty about his instincts does not bode well for alliance management. Indeed, his innate isolationism and nativist demagoguery portend two kinds of trouble for U.S. relations with Israel. First, Trump would enter office as the only genuinely isolationist president since the 19th century—an unsettling prospect for Israel, which depends heavily on U.S. internationalism (and an experience that Israel, which is only 68 years old, has never had). Although not, as a rule, philosophically inclined, Trump has expressed a coherent view of international relations as fiercely transactional and zero sum. This view extends to alliances, as he made clear in a New York Times interview in which he explicitly disavowed America’s Article 5 guarantee to defend NATO allies including Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. “If we cannot be properly reimbursed for the tremendous cost of our military protecting other countries, and in many cases the countries I’m talking about are extremely rich … Then yes, I would be absolutely prepared to tell those countries, 'Congratulations, you will be defending yourself.”’ In the world according to Trump, alliances such as NATO are inherently bad arrangements for the United States because the country is defending European allies who have little capacity to reciprocate, and who are unwilling to adequately pay for their protection. Likewise, maintaining a nuclear umbrella over South Korea and Japan seems to be a foolish and dangerous entanglement when those countries could just as well develop and deploy nuclear weapons themselves. And, of course, ”isolationism” is a mild term for what Trump conceives as the proper relationship between the U.S. and its southern neighbor. Perhaps Trump will make an exception to his expectation of a “return on investment” for commitment to allies, and he will stand by Israel no matter what it can or cannot do for the U.S. in return. If so, however, it would be out of character. Second, Trump’s invective against Muslims and other immigrant communities might appear in sync with Israeli hard-liners—the GOP nominee has indeed pointed to Israel’s security barrier and security profiling of Muslims as models for his own Great Wall on the Mexican border and promised ban on Muslims entering the country. But if Israel’s government really prefers Trump on this basis, this will drive another wedge between Israel and American Jews. Most American Jews are politically liberal, and they are particularly allergic to fear-mongering rhetoric against minorities. The experience of millennia has taught them that security for diaspora communities depends on a general climate of liberal tolerance. When demagogues single out minorities, Jews have to ask themselves—are we next? So, to take a small but telling example, when Trump has said that “my Jews”—presumably his employees—used to say “Merry Christmas,” and implies that his presidency will usher in a new era in which “Happy Holidays” will be a euphemism of the past, American Jews are not amused. The fact is, the U.S.-Israel alliance needs to be nurtured for the long haul, which means facing up to its real problems and reinforcing its moral foundations. It is wrong to think that the problems between Obama and Netanyahu have been determined by the personalities of the two leaders. Generational transformation on both sides has deepened strategic differences over the best way to manage a fragile regional balance of power, Palestinian political aspirations, and the increasingly anarchic conditions in the region. Israel is becoming more religious and less democratic. The United States is becoming more diverse—this, after all, is what Trump’s followers are angry about—and, arguably, more liberal. Surveys of young Israeli Jews show a sharp decline in support of Israel’s identity as a democratic state, from 26.1 percent in 1998 to 14.3 percent today. The growing religious nationalist population is becoming increasingly powerful in Israeli politics and society, including the Israel Defense Force. In 1990, 2.5 percent of officer candidates self-identified as religious, compared with 26 percent in 2008. Young Americans, in contrast, are more liberal than their parents on matters related to Israel-Palestine. A recent Pew Survey indicated that 57 percent of self-styled “liberal Democrats” sympathized with Palestinians more than Israel—at a time when younger Democrats are more and more likely to call themselves liberal. Politics in both countries appear to be tracking these trends. Last May, Netanyahu fired Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon for defending a senior officer’s right to criticize the government. Rather than seek to shore up his coalition by replacing him with a center-left figure, Netanyahu opted for the far-right wing Avigdor Lieberman as defense minister, creating what Israeli columnist Nahum Barnea has called “the most radical government … in Israeli history.” Meanwhile, as Guiliani has contended, it may well be right that the Democratic Party’s leftward movement could bring additional tensions to relations with Israel. Bernie Sanders supporters on the Democratic Platform Committee failed in the effort to include language more harshly critical of the Israel occupation of the West Bank. There is little doubt, however, that this represented the views of many of his younger supporters. *** What can be done to revive the U.S.-Israel relationship, under either a President Clinton or President Trump? In our recent book on U.S.-Israel relations, we suggest that one approach would be to negotiate a formal alliance enshrined in a treaty that would specify mutual responsibilities. The U.S. would undertake a legally binding commitment to defend Israel from attack, particularly by Iran. Although the White House has already declared this commitment publicly, a solemn treaty obligation would inject it with greater credibility in Iranian as well as Israeli eyes. To underscore the depth of obligation, the U.S. could deploy a tripwire force—as it long did in the Asia and Europe—to ensure that Israel’s adversaries understood that an attack on Israel would be tantamount to one on Americans that would bring the United States into any military conflict. In return, Israel would agree to a final status accord with the Palestinians along the territorial lines that the U.S. has long endorsed: the 1967 borders with mutually agreed swaps. The U.S., working closely with Israel and Jordan, would not only help secure the parties’ safety, but work with European donors to put the new Palestinian state on a firm footing to reduce the possibility of revanchist violence. Under this arrangement, the U.S. would contemplate a military assistance package that came closer to Israel’s vision for the one that has just been signed, while Israel’s withdrawal from the West Bank would ensure robust trade ties with Europe well into the future. Many on both sides will say that this program entails too many risks for too uncertain a gain. Israelis for whom past is prologue will argue that the practical benefits of a treaty is available at no cost. It certainly doesn’t fit with Donald Trump’s purely transactional view of international relations. But in an increasingly violent Middle East, it behooves both countries to reconsecrate a relationship based on a shared moral and strategic vision. As a matter of moral temperament and strategic vision, Hillary Clinton would appear far more likely to make this happen.",true
"Charlotte has seen some of the worst rioting over a cop shooting in a while and regardless of what the liberal media labels these people, they are not protesters. Protesters have a right to protest. They are protected under the Constitution. No. These folks we have here are rioters. They have burned, smashed, looted and now murdered each other over the latest police shooting (by the way, the officer was black).  Justin Carr, 26, passed away on Thursday after being critically wounded during the riots over the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by a black police officer. Carr was shot as rioters fought with police in riot gear lined arm-in-arm standing guard at the Omni Hotel at about 8:30 pm. City officials say Carr was not shot by an officer, but some protesters have claimed that he was wounded by a cop. No arrests have been made in Carr’s death, but a homicide investigation has been launched.  Police Chief Kerr Putney has put detectives on the case to try and find out who it was that made the shot, while the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice have other plans… ‘I saw the man go down on the pavement,’ Minister Steve Knight of Mission gathering Christian Church in Charlotte said. ‘It was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.’ Of course. Rioters are burning, looting and beating people, and it’s the cops. These people are pathetic. Knight also claimed: ‘We would like to see surveillance video from the surrounding area that may have captured the shooting to determine who was responsible for the shooting.’ Justin Carr is dead.

"Comedian and actor Zach Galifianakis recently featured former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on his improvisational comedy interview show, Between Two Ferns. Previously, he’s interviewed President Obama as well as other celebrities like Brad Pitt and Justin Beiber, but there’s one person he refuses to have on the show. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, Galifianakis was asked if he would have Republican nominee Donald Trump on his show since his interview with Clinton was such a resounding success – and his answer is hilarious. “No. That doesn’t interest me. Doing it the other way doesn’t interest me. He’s the kind of guy who likes attention – bad attention or good attention. So you’re dealing with a psychosis there that’s a little weird. I wouldn’t have somebody on that’s so mentally challenged. I feel like I’d be taking advantage of him. And you can print that.” Between Two Ferns is known for its exceptionally awkward dialogue and for the host’s fondness for asking uncomfortable questions (he once asked Pres. Obama “How does it feel to know you’re going to be the last black president?”). Part of the joke is both parties attempting to maintain their composure and not rising to the bait. Judging from the way that Donald Trump lashes out like a wounded animal at the slightest provocation and is utterly incapable of letting the pettiest slight go without a response, it’s safe to say that Galifinakis is right about how Trump would fare on his show. But it’s terrifying to think that a man who couldn’t handle being on a comedy interview show has a real shot at ascending to the presidency of the United States; he has shown time and time again that he is temperamentally unfit for the office.",fake
"NEW YORK — There's at least one Muslim country that Donald Trump has ""great respect"" for. The Republican presidential nominee Monday showered Egypt's increasingly autocratic ruler, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, with kind words during a special meeting on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. Story Continued Below Trump, who has called for a ban on immigration from countries ""compromised by terrorism,"" which presumably would include Egypt, promised to invite Sisi to visit the White House if he's elected president. Trump also suggested he'd like to visit Egypt. In a strikingly praise-filled summary of the meeting released by his campaign, the Republican was said to express to Sisi ""his strong support for Egypt’s war on terrorism, and how under a Trump administration, the United States of America will be a loyal friend, not simply an ally, that Egypt can count on in the days and years ahead."" Trump also was said to have ""emphasized"" to Sisi ""his high regard for peace-loving Muslims."" The statement came the same day that the real estate mogul, responding to a suspected terrorist attack in New York, lamented that police officers weren't allowed to use racial profiling. Sisi also met with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Both the 2016 candidates have been criticized by people across the political spectrum for sparing any time for Sisi, whose harsh rule has infuriated human rights activists. But Egypt is still considered a vital ally for the United States, not least because it maintains a peace deal with Israel and is a relatively stable Arab country in an increasingly volatile Middle East. It also is considered an important partner in the battle against Islamist militancy. The meeting between Trump and Sisi also included Trump advisers, Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. According to the readout, Trump expressed ""great respect for Egypt’s history"" and a ""great fondness"" for the Egyptian people. The readout did not say what Sisi said in return to Trump. Egyptian officials did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday from POLITICO.",true
"The scramble to cover-up the Hillary email scandal has come to light. The Platte River IT executives were not ignorant to what was going on. As subcontractors, they tried to distance themselves from what was going on. One executive call it; Hillary’s cover-up operation. It is astonishing that the FBI and the whole of the Justice Department were unable (unwilling) to see this. Read more below.  As Written By Isabel Vincent and Melissa Klein for The New York Post: Computers from China and Russia tried to attack Hillary Clinton’s private e-mail server, according to never-released e-mails from the Denver company that set up and maintained the system. And other internal e-mails show the IT executives fretted about being ordered to purge e-mails and scrambled to distance themselves from what they believed was the former first lady “covering up some shaddy [shady] s- -t.” In a gallows-humor message, one called it “Hillary’s coverup operation.” The FBI in July chastised Clinton and her aides over the use of the private server, saying, “They were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.” But the agency declined to recommend charges. The FBI report noted there were many hacking attempts into the system, both while Clinton was secretary of state and afterward when Platte River Networks took over the administration of the home server. The agency said none had been successful, and it never named the hackers or their points of origin. But multiple internal Platte River e-mails reviewed by The Post show that computers in China tried on three occasions in 2014 to log into Clinton’s server and a computer in Russia tried once in 2013. The internal communications also revealed how the execs belatedly tightened security on Clinton’s now-controversial home server and frantically sought to “cover our asses” when news broke that the former secretary of state’s communications were deleted. “Any chance you found an old e-mail with their directives to cut the backups back in Oct‐-Feb? . . .

"The Obama administration on Thursday terminated the federal recognition of the nation's largest accreditor of for-profit colleges — a rare move that could ultimately jeopardize the ability of hundreds of schools to access federal funding. The decision against the Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools amounts to what is effectively a death penalty. The sanction had been sought by prominent critics of for-profit colleges like Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who on Thursday called the accreditor a ""negligent"" organization that had ""rubber-stamped shady institutions"" for years. Story Continued Below The accreditor's seal of approval had allowed billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded Pell Grants and federal loans to flow to the now-defunct Corinthian Colleges chain of schools, which shut down last year amid allegations that it lured in prospective students using false, inflated job placement rates. ACICS was also the accreditor for ITT Tech, another troubled for-profit college that declared bankruptcy last week. The accreditor says that about 600,000 students across the country are enrolled at colleges that it approves. ACICS officials on Thursday pledged to appeal the decision directly to Education Secretary John B. King Jr. — a move that would temporarily put the termination on hold. There’s no timeline for when King must act on that appeal, but earlier this week he pledged to get it “resolved quickly.” Roger Williams, the interim president of ACICS, said in a statement that the group was “disappointed” in the decision but “confident” it could show “ongoing progress” toward coming into compliance with federal rules. If the Education Department stands by its decision, ACICS-accredited colleges would have 18 months to find a new accreditor, or else their students would lose access to federal money. Congress earlier this week passed legislation that allows GI Bill educational benefits to continue to flow to student veterans for up to 18 months after their school’s accreditor loses its federal recognition. Like other college accreditors, ACICS acts as a gatekeeper for federal money: Last year, it allowed 243 colleges to tap into $4.76 billion worth of Pell Grants and federal student loans. The Obama administration's termination decision was based upon earlier Education Department findings that ACICS failed to properly monitor and discipline the colleges it oversees. “ACICS’s track record does not inspire confidence that it can address all of the problems effectively,” wrote Emma Vadehra, King's chief of staff, who issued the ruling. “Many of the problems identified in the staff report are serious and long-standing.” ACICS has been a prime target of for-profit critics and some Senate Democrats in recent years. Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), on Thursday praised the administration’s decision in a statement, saying that “far too many schools have maintained their institutional accreditation, even while defrauding and misleading students.” But Rep. John Kline (R-Minn.) blasted the Education Department’s decision as “an unprecedented action that could disrupt the education of hundreds of thousands of students, particularly low-income and minority students.” The for-profit industry's trade association argued that the department’s decision is yet another example of the unfair targeting of their industry by the Obama administration. ""The U.S. Department of Education's decision today will have horrible ramifications for hundreds of thousands of students, thousands of dedicated faculty and staff, and hundreds of communities and employers that rely on institutions accredited by ACICS,” said Steve Gunderson, who leads the Career Education Colleges and Universities trade group. ""No Administration has politicized accreditation like the current one.” Ben Miller, senior director of Postsecondary Education at the Center for American Progress, authored a report criticizing the record of ACICS that was frequently cited by a federal panel in making its recommendation to nix the accreditor. Miller praised Thursday's decision, calling it a ""landmark step for protecting students and taxpayers."" Terry Hartle, senior vice president at the American Council on Education, said schools without any red flags can probably find a new accreditor in one year to 18 months, but it could take two years or much longer for other schools to find a new home. “It’s a major step,” Hartle said. “The department has done it at least once before, but never with an accreditation agency of this size.” Kimberly Hefling contributed to this report.",true
"Washington (CNN)Eric Trump on Friday defended his father's self-made real estate mogul narrative, saying the Republican presidential nominee was the epitome of the American dream for having ""gone from just about nothing"" to become a successful real estate mogul in New York. The younger Trump's comments follow extensive reporting of how the GOP presidential candidate got his start in property development in part thanks to a $1 million loan from his father, Fred Trump, in the late 1960s or early 1970s. ""Well, I think he's a guy who has been an entrepreneurial guy,"" Eric Trump told Fox News on Friday after being asked about his father's outreach to millennial voters. ""He's built an amazing company. He's become the epitome of the American dream."" Trump begun to say that millennials could relate to his father because ""he's gone from just about nothing,"" but was interrupted by ""Outnumbered"" panelist Julie Roginsky. ""Nothing? He got a million bucks? I mean, come on,"" Roginsky interjected. ""Listen, he's built an unbelievable empire,"" Trump responded. ""He's epitomized what America is all about: opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams and what you want to succeed, right?"" Trump continued, ""It's no different from a (Mark) Zuckerberg, right, who went out with a great idea like Facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it and grew it. That's achieving something, right? And I think it is very different than a person who has been career politician."" In 2015, Donald Trump described the $1 million loan from his father as ""small."" ""My whole life really has been a 'no' and I fought through it,"" Trump said at an NBC-sponsored town hall in October. ""It has not been easy for me, it has not been easy for me. And you know I started off in Brooklyn, my father gave me a small loan of a million dollars."" The 32-year-old Eric Trump on Friday also said that he thought millennials did not relate to policy well because ""they haven't lived their lives long enough to understand ... the broad stroke of issues."" ""They obviously understand a lot of issues as it pertains to them, student debt, and this and that,"" Trump said. ""But I think maybe taxes and things might be a little less significant than other issues. And so I just think there is a disconnect between somebody who is constantly talking about policy and this and that, than a man who's built a great company."" Donald Trump's children have become prominent surrogates for his unconventional presidential campaign, but at times have cause minor controversies of their own. Eric Trump's comments come after his older brother, Donald Jr., caused controversy earlier this week when he likened Syrian refugees to Skittles. ",true
"Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it’s one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president. This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises… because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton… EVER. From Bearing Arms: We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn’t tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy. Falconer’s Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love. The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer’s to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare. Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers “immunity.” It’s an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation. Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished.  ",fake
"Democratic President Barack Obama pulled off a historic diplomatic coup when he engineered an accord with Iran to freeze their nuclear program for ten years in exchange for lifting the sanctions that had been strangling their economy. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton engineered the tough economic sanctions that dragged Iran to the negotiating table after ex-Vice President Dick Cheney rebuffed their efforts at negotiation, convincing countries like China and Russia to act in unison with the United States and against their own short term business interests. It was a major diplomatic accomplishment and made our world safer. Did Trump just say US gave Iran $150 billion? Did I really hear that? — Arash Karami (@thekarami) September 27, 2016  Republican nominee Donald Trump keeps spewing complete fabrications about the  Iran accords which President Obama concluded at the start of this year. He started by repeating the lie Fox News planted about America paying $400 million dollars of Iran’s own cash back to them, at the conclusion of the agreements. It was money America owed Iran under a legal agreement. The State Department returned $400 million to the Iranian government, but it was money that we owed them. We didn’t “give” them anything. In the 1970s, the United States made a deal to sell $400 million of fighter jets to the Shah of Iran. The Shah paid upfront but was then deposed in the Iranian revolution, so the United States never delivered the jets. As part of the nuclear disarmament deal, the Iranian government simple wanted their money back if we weren’t going to cough up the jets. In Trump’s mind, that money inflated to $150 billion. Cash to paid to Iran as part of the lifting of sanctions rises from $400million to $1.5 billion to $150 billion according to Trump. #debates — Albert Rapacioli (@speedlinefoto) September 27, 2016  Bingo! Trump's Iran cash lie. Much debunked. — Sarah Reese Jones (@PoliticusSarah) September 27, 2016  Not only has the Republican nominee devoted most of his false statements about Iran to lying, he thinks it’s a great idea to start a needless war, with a country whose help we need to settle the disastrous Syrian Civil War. That’s when Hillary Clinton blew Trump out of the water for his empty threats about Iran which either look horrifically weak, or are calculated to start a war which would cost Americans dearly in blood and treasure, all to satisfy the outsize ego of a Republican that no sane voter should choose in November. #Debates2016 Clinton- Trump said he'd blow Iran boaters out of water & start another war. Trumps casual attitude about nuclear weapons. — Susan Maylone (@SusanMaylone) September 27, 2016  But Trump wasn’t content to leave a couple of lies alone, and went all the way out into his own Republican echo-chamber to land a Ben Carson sized fake zinger, claiming that North Korea is somehow controlled by Iran. Which is absurd. Trump: “Iran has power over North Korea.” What? #debates — Christina Wilkie (@christinawilkie) September 27, 2016 ",true
"Donald Trump's presidential transition operation has recruited GOP energy lobbyist Mike McKenna and vocal climate skeptic Myron Ebell to run teams focused on the Energy Department and EPA respectively, according to people familiar with the hires. David Bernhardt, the co-chair of the natural resources department at the firm Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck and a George W. Bush Interior Department official, is leading the transition's Interior Department team, sources said. Story Continued Below McKenna, is a well-connected energy lobbyist with ties to the industry-backed American Energy Alliance and Institute for Energy Research. McKenna has lobbied for the Dow Chemical Company, Southern Company and Koch Companies Public Sector, which terminated his contract in May, according to public records. According to his website, McKenna previously served as an ""external relations specialist"" at the Energy Department. Ebell is the director of the Center for Energy and Environment at the Competitive Enterprise Institute. He is a prominent skeptic of climate science and a regular critic of the Obama administration's environmental policies. But he has never worked at the EPA.

"North Carolina Republicans are lamenting the unrest gripping their state’s largest city, but, quietly, they also see it as an opportunity for Donald Trump to gain ground in a critical swing state. And they’re asking him to take advantage of it. Story Continued Below “North Carolina Republicans are sending the word to the Trump campaign that once this settles down, a visit to Charlotte, to the Mecklenburg police, to the sheriff and others, is something we really want to see,” said a high-ranking North Carolina Republican, granted anonymity to discuss political calculations during a sensitive moment for the state. “Lawmakers and party officials are sending word to the Trump campaign.” The crisis in Charlotte was sparked by the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, an African-American man who police say was armed, though no video has been released and the family disputes that claim. Since then, the city has been the scene of violent clashes between police and protesters, with the clashes captured on live, national television. The tumult comes as Hillary Clinton’s once-formidable lead in state polls has faded. A spate of polls out this week show either a tied race or give Trump a slight edge—a sharp contrast from last month, when Clinton was leading by anywhere from 2 to 9 percentage points. North Carolina political operatives are skeptical that, unless the chaos in Charlotte continues for weeks, the issue will make a substantial dent in the race. But Republicans and some Democrats do say that the dynamic creates an opening for Trump to further shore up and energize the GOP base—something he has struggled to do—predicting voters will respond to his campaign’s law-and-order message and his staunch defense of police, even amid national concerns over institutional police racism. A senior adviser to the Trump campaign said only that Trump had been in the state earlier this week and ""we have not yet announced the date of our next trip back to the state."" “I certainly think unrest feeds into Trump’s narrative that ‘America’s falling apart, we need to make America great again,’” said Tom Jensen, a Democratic pollster whose firm is based in North Carolina. “My sense is, most white North Carolinians who would be really repulsed by what’s going on in Charlotte would be in Trump’s camp. I doubt it moves the needle a lot, but the race is just about tied … something like that is never going to move the race by 3 or 4 points, but it can change the race on the margins, and we’re on the margins.” Thus far, Clinton has largely stuck to tweeting in support of Scott, rather than commenting on the Wednesday night protests. And Trump was vague in a Fox News appearance Thursday morning, lamenting the “lack of spirit between the white and the black,” and going on to assert that amid the chaos “our country looks bad to the world” in a speech later in the day. But moving the needle even a little may be enough in a state where the polls are tight and there’s a history of thin margins. North Carolina, a typically red state that went for Barack Obama in 2008 before swinging back to support Mitt Romney in 2012, is central to Trump’s path to victory, which is narrower than Clinton’s is. Clinton’s summer leads in the state were fueled by support from African-American and college-educated voters in a state that is home to the Research Triangle, the Raleigh-Durham area where universities and high-tech companies are based. But in North Carolina, as in a number of other swing states, her lead has diminished amid scrutiny of her email practices, her health and her overall commitment to transparency. And the protests, Republicans say, may mean more trouble, especially if there are additional nights of strife. “Every time there is a riot, protest, or general disruption of civility it helps Donald Trump,” said Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster who was the director of data, analytics and digital strategy on Ted Cruz’s primary campaign. The Cruz primary campaign had firsthand experience with this: Protests at a Chicago Trump rally ahead of the March 15 primaries—when a list of states that included North Carolina voted—dominated the weekend coverage before those races. Wilson said the net effect was boosting Trump across the board in the final days before the Republican contests (though representatives from Sen. Marco Rubio's campaign, also watching their own internal numbers, have said they didn’t see the same effect). “We certainly saw this in the primaries as the riots [in] Chicago, prior to a scheduled Trump speech, created a significant lift for Trump’s candidacy,” Wilson said. “Not just in Illinois, but also in Missouri and North Carolina.” The unrest also carries risks for Trump, as the charged racial questions surrounding the issue heighten the possibility of a misstatement, one that could undo a recent effort to fight charges that he’s a racist candidate. That is a risk for the bombastic Trump, who has a record of horrifying moderate voters in the wake of tragedies (“Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism,” he tweeted, following a shooting at a gay nightclub in Orlando, though he said he didn’t want the “congrats”). And the Charlotte situation carries opportunities for Clinton as well. African-Americans, a crucial part of her base, have been outraged by the shooting, the latest instance of a black man dying in an altercation with police (in this instance, the police officer involved was also African-American). Clinton has been a champion of “Mothers of the Movement,” a group of African-American mothers whose children died primarily in incidents involving law enforcement, and she is a vocal proponent of criminal justice reform. In North Carolina and nationally, her campaign is engaged in extensive outreach to the African-American community. A senior Democratic operative working in North Carolina said the incidents unfolding in Charlotte underscore the risks African-Americans see in a potential President Trump. “It is further alienation, a further concern among African-American voters about Trump’s presidency,” the source said, noting that Trump has a long record of making incendiary comments about minorities. The strategist said Trump’s best-case scenario, politically, is that calls for law and order help him solidify his base—but that doesn’t move the dial with independent and more moderate voters, the source insisted. “I think Donald Trump continues to solidify his 43 percent of the vote, he’s not adding votes, he’s certainly alienating others,” the Democrat said, going on to add, “It just confirms to his base all the things they’re concerned about are real. But shoring up 43 percent of the vote you have is not the way to get to 50.” And Carter Wrenn, a longtime Republican strategist, said it is not a given that Trump’s standing will rise on the other side of the aisle just because of the protests. “If you’re living in North Carolina, you turn on the TV and there’s riots in Charlotte, there’s looting, it gets your attention, but it doesn’t automatically help one candidate over another,” he said. “It depends on how the individual candidate responds. People will watch that. If they think, ‘Gosh, Trump’s got a lot of judgment, he knows how to solve this,' it will help him. If they think, ‘Old Trump just poured gas on the fire,’ it won’t help him at all.”",true
"There is a moment at every Donald Trump rally when Donald Trump marvels at the crazy spectacle he’s created. “Is there any place in America as fun as a Donald Trump rally?” he asks with a mischievous pursed-lip grin. The moment always comes after a protester tries to interrupt him, only to be drowned out by an arena full of rowdy white people screaming “TRUMP! TRUMP! TRUMP!” That’s the fun part, the joint release of pent-up fury by thousands of proudly politically incorrect Americans. When you experience it in person, you can feel their catharsis as they vent at the whiners and moochers and Mexicans and Muslims taking over their country, gleefully defying the scolds who call them racist and rude for respecting the police and saying Merry Christmas. “Donald Trump has singlehandedly untied our tongues,” a chain-saw artist named Chris Cox, the founder of Bikers 4 Trump, told me at a recent Pensacola rally. Story Continued Below When Trump fans are asked about his appeal, the first thing they usually say is that he isn’t a normal politician. And his rambling, fear-mongering, name-calling public speeches, no matter how hard his new handlers try to keep him on his new teleprompter, do not feel like normal political events. They feel like Wrestlemania with a different kind of hero and a different kind of performance art. They feel like revival meetings for the Donald J. Trump Church of Cultural Resentment, with ritual denunciations of Crooked Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama—“We call him President Obama, because we have to treat him with respect, right?”—and other enemies of the congregation. At a time when Americans say they’re tired of politics as usual, Trump offers politics as deeply, often disturbingly, always unapologetically, unusual. His opponent does not. Clinton’s events feel exactly like normal political events. She may be the world’s most famous and polarizing woman, but she’s running an almost generic Democratic campaign, politics as very usual. Tonight, Hillary Clinton will take on Donald Trump in perhaps the most anticipated presidential debate ever, a rhetorical clash of two candidates with diametrically opposed life histories, policy agendas, and bases of support. But their contrasting records and ideas haven’t been the defining divides of this strange political year. What 2016 is really about is conventional versus not. And no matter what happens tonight, when you spend time at their diametrically opposed events, you’re constantly reminded that what makes this year so abnormal is Trump. He is violating all the rules of the political game—rules that promote pandering and artifice as well as rules that promote transparency and decency—and when 2016 is over, it’s not clear whether those rules will still apply. Whatever you think of Clinton, she tends to observe polite-society political traditions, which is why her events would feel familiar to anyone who’s attended a modern campaign stop. The backdrops are decorated with red-white-and-blue bunting and talking-point slogans like “Love Trumps Hate” or “Stronger Together.” The small venues are selected to target niche groups—millennials last week at Temple University in Philadelphia, the disabled a few days later at a family outreach center in Orlando—and the crowds are carefully curated to avoid protests or other surprises. The speeches are standard campaign fare, dotted with wonky statistics and real-person anecdotes to buttress well-researched policy proposals. The candidate, as she has for nearly four decades in public life, sticks to her prepared text. Her audiences are supportive, though not particularly emotive. “I thought it was very substantial, very specific,” Glenn McCoy, an adult educator at a Catholic church who wore a “Hil Yes!” pin to Clinton’s speech about supporting disabled workers in Orlando. “The purpose wasn’t to whip the crowd into a frenzy. We’re not looking to choose a president based on emotion.” Clinton had better hope not. There’s electricity at Trump rallies that hers can’t match. It’s no coincidence that cable news often ignores her speeches to carry the Trump shows live. His crowds wait with giddy anticipation for him to name and shame enemies, like NASCAR fans waiting for wrecks, and they explode when he calls out the dishonest media, the job-stealing Chinese, the PC sensitivity snobs who think you’re prejudiced if you want to keep illegal immigrants and Islamic terrorists out of the country. It’s entertaining to watch him violate norms, declaring Clinton lacks the stamina to be president, suggesting her security detail ought to disarm, warning the election will probably be rigged. He flings out absurd claims about the skewing of the unemployment rate, the savagery of inner cities, even the temperature at his rallies. (“It’s 100 degrees in here. And that’s considered cool for an auditorium.”) He casually drops one outlandish bombshell—the Federal Reserve is corrupt, the FBI is covering up for Clinton, NAFTA was the worst deal in the history of the world—then moves onto another before the last fully explodes. Clinton doesn’t do that. Whatever one thinks about her email protocols or Benghazi or her penchant for secrecy, she campaigns like a typical candidate. She has the strengths and weaknesses of a typical public servant, and takes typical measures to try to frame them for the public. Her problem is that Trump’s unique combination of insult comedy and monster-truck rally, despite the flagrant abuse of facts and unsettling whiff of menace, is exposing the focus-grouped, stage-managed, paint-by-numbers nature of typical candidacies. Clinton isn’t getting a lot of credit for following the rules of a game that always seemed inauthentic. Nobody understands that better than the political savant named Donald J. Trump. He tells a lot of straight-faced falsehoods about Clinton’s campaign, like his accusations that it’s “policy-free,” when he used to mock it for churning otut too many policy proposals, and when Trump himself recently laid off much of his policy shop. But there’s something to his caricature of Clinton events as the lackluster politics of yesteryear. At a rally in Miami, he did a sly imitation of Clinton's speeches—he claimed with faux specificity that they're only 18 minutes, when they're usually twice that long—with a bored expression that suggested she just phones them in. “Bom. Bom. Bom. See ya!” Trump smirked. “See ya! I’m going home.” Many Americans really do seem sick of Bom-Bom-Bom-See-Ya politics. But the live experience of Trump’s say-anything middle-finger alternative can be a bracing advertisement for the mundane traditions he’s shredding every day. *** Before attending a recent Trump rally in Pensacola, I watched a video of his last rally there during the Republican primary in January. At the time, the news from the event had been his I’m-just-saying speculation that questions about Ted Cruz’s citizenship might be disqualifying. But starting with the Star Spangled Banner, performed by a kids group that later sued Trump for breach of contract, the entire rally seemed like a trip through the looking glass to an alternative political planet. Trump spent the first 10 minutes of his hourlong soliloquy bashing the “bad, dishonest, very bad people” in the media for failing to show the public the size of his crowds, a theme he revisited three more times. He criticized a U.S. soldier for using the word “sir” to address the Iranians who briefly captured him. He advised Americans to take their money out of the stock market, which he described as “a big fat bubble,” and predicted a collapse that would be “beautiful to watch.” He gleefully pointed out a black man in the stands: “I didn’t put him there! I’m not paying him!” He read a long poem about a deadly snake that was supposed to show the danger of Syrian refugees, called himself “more militaristic than anyone in this room,” complained that Common Core education bureaucrats make $400,000 a year—actually the president’s salary—and announced the American Dream was dead. Oh, he also unleashed a diatribe about incompetent contractors and staff after his microphone crackled. “Whoever the hell brought this mic system—don’t pay the son of a bitch!” he seethed. “Don’t pay em. Don’t pay em. You know, I believe in paying, but when somebody does a bad job, like this stupid mic, you shouldn’t pay the bastard. Terrible. You gotta be tough with your people, because they’ll pay, they don’t care. So we’re not going to pay. I guarantee, I’m not paying for this mic.” So I was ready for more theater of the bizarre when Trump returned eight months later to Pensacola’s 12,000-seat arena, which was once again packed to capacity. Vendors sold Trump That Bitch t-shirts and Trump 2016 Confederate flags. The pastor giving the invocation shouted: “Tyranny has raised its ugly head! Our constitution is under attack!” The crowd started chanting “LOCK HER UP!” before Trump even appeared. He then took the stage to a tremendous roar, and…well, to be honest, he seemed a lot less provocative than I had expected. “He’s freeing up our speech,” said one Trump supporter. “We can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty… Maybe we’ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.” Trump was now using a teleprompter, which he had derided as a tool of inauthenticity in January, and while he used it more as a guideline than a script, it was still jarring to hear him regurgitate staff-written clichés and Republican talking points about “encrusted insiders” and “turning the page.” He said the kind of things regular politicians say: “The history books are closing on the failed politicians of yesterday.” And: “Once again, we’ll have a government of, by, and for the people.” He even recited the monotonous details of a military investment plan a conservative think tank had prepared for him, name-checking new naval vessels in a town with a naval base. The crowd was noisier and angrier than a normal political crowd—during one Trump riff about lifting minorities out of poverty, a supporter in a red-white-and-blue trucker hat screamed: “What about white people?”—but the rally still felt at least quasi-normal. Trump did repeat a few of his radical proposals that remain astounding when you think about them, like a 35 percent tax on imports and his Mexico-financed wall—but really, who still thinks about them? Afterwards, though, I saw a breaking story about an offhand comment Trump had made warning that if Iranian sailors ever made rude gestures at Americans when he was president, as they apparently had during a minor incident a few weeks earlier, their ships would be blown out of the water. Trump had essentially threatened to launch World War 3, and I hadn’t noticed. Back at my hotel, I checked my notes and was reminded that he had also literally accused Clinton of causing “all the problems in the world,” including North Korean nuclear tests that began under George W. Bush. He had mused that “personally, I think she’s an unstable person,” and complained that she could walk into the arena and shoot someone “right smack in the middle of the heart—and she wouldn’t be prosecuted, OK?” He had denied cozying up to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin—and then he had cozied up again: “He’s been nice to me, and if he’s nice to me, that’s fine. If we got along with Russia, that wouldn’t be so bad, would it?” And at a time of low unemployment, cheap gas, and new data showing that wages grew and poverty shrunk in 2015 at the fastest rate in decades, Trump had flatly declared that “the country is collapsing.” Those all would have been jaw-dropping statements during any other campaign from any other candidate, but the Year of Trump has desensitized many of us to his rapid-fire transgressions. We’re normalizing the unprecedented. At a rally a few days later in Asheville, N.C., Trump called the U.S. military “incredibly weak,” defended a male spectator who roughed up a 68-year-old female protester, and said the black community—which endured slavery and Jim Crow—was “in the worst shape they’ve ever been. Ever! Ever! Ever!” Yet the main Trump story from the Associated Press focused on how he had refrained from attacking Clinton over her bout with pneumonia, under the headline “Restraint on Clinton Health Shows New Campaign Discipline.” Predictably, Trump mocked Clinton’s health problems later in the week, suggesting she needed more sleep, warning she didn’t have enough energy to handle the rigors of the White House, falsely claiming he was holding four rallies a day and then just as falsely claiming she couldn’t make it through one. That sort of behavior just hasn’t been seen on the presidential campaign trail. But it’s that defiant you-can’t-tell-me-what-I’m-supposed-to-say spirit that Trump loyalists love. “He’s not a politician. Nobody controls him. A lot of us are tired of worrying about people’s feelings, always watching our P’s and Q’s, so it’s cool to see him speak his mind,” said Alan Smith, a 43-year-old firefighter from nearby Gulf Breeze who recently retired on his municipal pension. Bill Turpin, a retired Army veteran from Brayton, Iowa, told me at a Trump rally outside Des Moines that while Clinton is a classic politician for whom lying is like breathing—he doesn’t even believe the official story about her health, because he fainted once, and he didn’t stumble around like she did on the video—Trump is a businessman with nothing to fear: “He’ll call a spade a spade, and if you don’t like it you can shove it.” Again and again, Trump supporters told me they appreciated the way he was fighting the forces of political correctness, standing up for their right to primal-scream what they believe about immigrants and terrorists and Black Lives Matter thugs. “He’s freeing up our speech,” said Norris Westfall, an auto detailer who wore an Infowars Liberty or Death t-shirt to a recent Trump rally in Asheville, N.C. “We can talk about the Muslim invasion. We can be against amnesty without everyone saying we’re offensive. Maybe we’ll be able to say Merry Christmas again.” It’s fashionable to attribute the Trump phenomenon to economic anxiety, but the Trump voters I interviewed at four separate rallies almost never mentioned it, unless complaints that the undocumented are getting jobs and welfare benefits counts as economic anxiety. They seemed less anxious about the state of the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition, and they seemed less anxious than pissed off—at a president many of them still consider a foreign usurper, at thought leaders more worried about Islamophobia than Islamic terror, at racial guilt-trippers who demonize cops while ignoring black-on-black crime. In Asheville, I watched an Air Force veteran named Gary Latham explode at some anti-Trump protesters who were chanting that they didn’t want hate in their state: “Lazy motherfuckers! Get a fucking job!” He explained to me that America was under siege, with “thousands of Syrian refugees embedded in western Carolina,” and that he was proud to be one of the vigilant Americans Clinton considered “deplorable.” The Trump voters I interviewed seemed less anxious about the Obama economy than the rise of the multicultural Obama coalition—and they seemed less anxious than pissed off. One of the speakers before Trump took the stage in Asheville was a white-haired lady who owns a custom frame shop and serves in the state legislature. She used the opportunity to proclaim: “We want our state rights back!” “We’re sick of the same old racism crap getting shoveled down our throats,” says Kim Buckner, a nursing assistant who wore a Don’t Tread on Me pin to the Asheville rally. “Trump is saying what we’re all thinking: ‘Screw you! Call us deplorable all you want! Our rights don’t end where your feelings begin!’” Trump echoes those anti-anti-racism tropes, describing accusations of racism as “the oldest play in the Democratic playbook.” And he’s begun regaling his white audiences with increasingly lurid descriptions of inner-city life, arguing that it’s so hellish blacks might as well vote Trump: “I’ll say it openly, and some people don’t like it, I don’t really care: What do you have to lose?” His long riffs about how he’ll fix neighborhoods so awful that blacks can’t walk down the street without getting shot have been described as outreach to non-racist whites, but in person, they feel much more like creepy concern-trolling for the benefit of jeering Trump fans who want to believe that blacks live like animals. When Trump claims that black youths don’t get an education and have an unemployment rate of 58 percent—the real rate is about one third of that—he’s fueling the kind of ugly stereotypes found all over the white-supremacy sites he retweets every now and then. The Trump supporters I interviewed seemed much less interested in supporting inner-city blacks than criticizing their lifestyles, bemoaning their dependence on government, and blaming their president. Polls show that most Trump supporters still think Obama was born in Kenya—and many I spoke to believe he’s also a Muslim who supports ISIS. One notable exception was Richard Cohen, a Jewish contractor who attended the rally in Asheville. Cohen told me Trump is pandering to racism, anti-Semitism, and fear of Hispanics among his supporters; he said a white friend with two adopted black sons left an earlier Trump event after hearing spectators yell the N-word. But Cohen supports Trump anyway, because he likes the idea of shaking up the timid, finger-in-the-wind political establishment. “A lot of us who like him don’t like the stuff he says about race,” Cohen said. “Obviously, some do.” This really isn’t normal. And while Clinton is an unlikely poster child for normal—a First Lady whose husband was impeached after cheating on her with an intern, a Secretary of State who agreed to serve the younger man who foiled her own presidential dreams—she presents herself on the trail as a dedicated but ordinary public servant who happens to be the alternative to a bigoted freak. I remember watching her execute a similar strategy in 2000 when she ran for a Senate seat in New York even though she had never lived in the state or pursued public office, even though her husband was still in the White House after his tabloid scandal had transfixed the nation. She simply ignored the weirdness of it all, running as a standard-issue Democrat in a Democratic state, diligently discussing dairy policy and upstate development as if nothing else mattered. And against a basically normal Republican candidate, it worked. A majority of New Yorkers agreed with her agenda, and sent her to the Senate to pursue it. In 2016, though, Clinton has struggled to make a case for normal. She’s tried to push a standard-issue Democratic agenda, but in the Year of Trump, the race hasn’t been about standard anything. *** Nearly one of every five Americans lives with a disability, and just about everyone else wishes them the best. So Clinton’s Orlando speech about valuing their work made sense politically as well as morally, as an expression of her commitment to helping the vulnerable and creating an “Inclusive Economy,” to quote the clunky slogan behind her podium. In the I-4 corridor that constitutes the swingiest region of the swingiest state, Clinton spoke to 300 supporters—a much smaller crowd than Trump regularly attracts, but far more diverse—about her goal of an America that recognizes the humanity and supports the potential of all its citizens. She also laid out a four-part plan her policy team had devised to help more disabled Americans flourish in the economy. Just two months before Election Day, the speech was designed to illustrate Clinton’s concern about a worthy issue. It did that, more or less. Afterwards, her supporters praised her seriousness of purpose, her depth of knowledge, her willingness to listen. Nobody mentioned eloquence or flair, but her people understand that she never hosted a reality show. “I thought it was a nice speech,” Lewis Smith, a retired mechanic in Orlando, told me afterwards. “Not very exciting, but I believe she’ll do what she says.” The speech started slowly, as Clinton spent nearly the first half on shoutouts to key supporters, a few made-for-TV soundbites about the riots in Charlotte, and an abridged version of her broader stump speech about an economy that works for everyone. Her speechwriters clearly cut-and-pasted in some of her standard lines about her middle-class origins, her support for family-friendly policies like paid leave, and a plug for her new book of campaign proposals about everything from Alzheimer’s disease to campus sexual assault to small business incubators. The rest of the speech was dedicated to the proposition that Clinton is committed to promoting the talents and dreams of disabled Americans who have been undervalued by society for too long. It was a nice sentiment, expressed through the kind of political saccharine that sends viewers scurrying for the remote control: “Across the country, people with disabilities are running businesses, teaching students, caring for our loved ones. They’re holding public office, making breakthrough scientific discoveries, reporting the news, and creating art that inspires and challenges us.” Maybe some disabled Americans create uninspiring art, but not in Hillary Clinton speeches. “In the United States of America, the greatest country in the world, we believe that everyone is created equal,” Clinton said. This kind of boilerplate scores a lot higher in truth value than in news value. Clinton did talk about her own work with the disabled, from her push for their right to attend school as a young Children’s Defense Fund lawyer to her appointment of the State Department’s first-ever advisor for disability rights. She mentioned disabled people she’s known—including the “unbelievably good-looking” actor Christopher Reeve, who told her that “family values” should mean that every family has value—and her discussions with advocates who said they want paychecks rather than pity. She then detailed her plan, which, while infinitely more substantive than anything Trump has ever said about disabilities, was mostly placeholders about partnering with schools and businesses, plus an elimination of the “sub-minimum wage” that is currently paid to some disabled workers. The audience responded with warmth, if not exuberance. But I must confess that after watching Trump claim Obamacare deductibles were so high you need to die a “really slow, vicious death” to exhaust them, accuse the Federal Reserve and the Justice Department of corruption, and tell his supporters he doesn’t feel bad if they’re working harder than ever because he is too, Clinton’s scripted remarks seemed noticeably dull. She gave a laudable and sensible political speech on an overlooked topic, but it felt like a political speech, a combination of virtue signaling and interest-group outreach. Cable covered a Trump rally instead, and was rewarded when boxing promoter Don King dropped an N-bomb in his introduction. There was nothing controversial or unpredictable in Clinton’s remarks; they mostly proved that she and her team had done their homework, and that unlike Trump, who talks mostly about himself, she knows enough to portray herself as part of a team. She didn’t even mention Trump’s reprehensible imitation of a disabled reporter, because she wanted a more positive message that day. She was careful to say nothing impolitic, which is, basically, politics. Geannie Bastian, a student with cerebral palsy, said her political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter. “Believe me, I’ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,” she said. “Trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.” In fairness to Clinton, there was a portion of the audience that seemed genuinely touched: The disabled and their families. Joe Kilsheimer, the mayor of a central Florida suburb, has a younger brother who was written off by doctors as a hopeless case when he was a baby, but went on to become the first Eagle Scout with Down’s Syndrome and lead a productive life. “What Hillary said about an inclusive economy really hit home,” Kilsheimer said. “I know a lot of people don’t trust her, because they see her filtered through politics and media, but she’s got heart.” Geannie Bastian, a University of Central Florida film student with cerebral palsy who gets around in a wheelchair, said she was moved by Clinton’s message that people like her matter and deserve to fulfill their potential. But she said her real political awakening came when Trump made fun of that reporter, whose hand looks quite similar to hers. “Believe me, I’ve seen that gesture a lot, but before it was always from children,” she said. “Trump is every playground bully every disabled kid ever knew.” Political scientists disagree about the importance of enthusiasm; voters only get to vote once, no matter how fired up they are, but they’re less likely to turn out to vote if they aren’t fired up. In any case, even at her own events, it’s a lot easier to find voters fired up to vote against the outrageousness of Trump than it is to find avid Clinton fans. Voters of color seem especially riled. I repeatedly heard from black Democrats offended by Trump’s crusade to deny that the first African-American president was American, and his stereotypes of their families as desperate charity cases with nothing to lose. “My daughter has a doctorate. Her husband is an orthodontist. We’ve got plenty to lose,” said Betty Edwards, a retired educator in the Orlando suburbs. “There’s never been a candidate who thought so little of us.” Many Hispanics are similarly energized by Trump’s calls for mass deportations and a wall, sensing not just honest disagreements over immigration policy but a broader push to make them feel like strangers in their own country. Andy Gutierrez, a singer and Puerto Rican voting activist who brought a Boricua Vota sign to the Orlando event, says Trump has been a one-man registration machine. “He thinks we’re all Mexicans, and we’re all bad,” Gutierrez said. “People aren’t super-excited about Hillary, but trust me, they’ll come out to stop Trump.” Clinton’s excitement problem is a real problem. At her university event in Philadelphia, millennials who had swooned over Bernie Sanders kept talking about her in the milquetoast terms they might use to describe a reasonably reliable accountant. “She’s OK, I guess,” said Thomas Davidenko, a freshman at Temple. “My main worry is Trump’s fingers on the nuclear code. But I’d say she knows what she’s doing.” In Orlando, I met more actual Clinton fans, especially older women who admired her as a feminist trailblazer, but even her staunch supporters said they’re struggling to persuade friends. Lou Smith, a union cell-tower technician for AT&T, said many of his Arab-hating white colleagues at work think she’s a typical lying politician, so they’re voting for Trump—and her Bernie-loving daughters think the same thing, so they’re staying home. “She’s been around so long, and Republicans have thrown so much mud on her,” he said. “She’s great on the issues, but it’s hard to get people to focus on that.” Clinton is a policy wonk, and one could imagine that a more normal campaign against a more normal Republican would have been closer to her wheelhouse. She could have focused on taxes and health insurance, climate change and diplomacy. She might have framed the election as the Democratic bottom-up approach that produced prosperity during her husband’s administration and recovery during Obama’s with the trickle-down philosophy that ended in economic collapse under Bush. “When Bill Clinton was in the chair, everybody was doing great, and then everything fell apart before Obama fixed it,” said Jeneka Lloyd, who owns a small painting business in Orlando. “Man, Hillary should talk about that.” But Trump is not a normal Republican, and 2016 hasn’t focused on his policies, because they’re so insubstantial and flexible, because he’s trashed Bush as well as Obama, because he has a gift for changing the subject with colorful Fox News interviews or incendiary tweets, and because his business record, charity scams and racial provocations provide such a target-rich environment beyond the issues. It’s a lot harder to persuade Americans of the magical thinking behind Trump’s plan to erase the national debt while expanding the military and slashing taxes than it is to attack him for denigrating a Gold Star family, looting his own charitable foundation, refusing to release his tax returns, and other unheard-of behavior. Meanwhile, the media have balanced the narrative with scandal coverage of her sketchy email situation and her own foundation. Her approval ratings have dropped lower than any modern major-party presidential nominee with the lone exception of Donald Trump. So Clinton has ended up in the proverbial mud-wrestling match with a pig. They’ve both gotten dirty. And neither she nor the public has liked it. *** Tonight on Long Island, Trump and Clinton will meet in a very conventional setting. And as usual, no one really has any idea how Trump will try to handle it, which is a big part of what makes him so compelling on television. His team is already warning moderator Lester Holt not to fact-check the candidates, which makes sense, given Trump’s distant relationship with facts. There will be rules governing the debate, but Trump’s political brand is all about breaking the rules. What is clear is that Trump will portray himself as the candidate of change, which is exactly what he is. He essentially wants to roll back the Obama era, repealing the president’s health care reforms, Wall Street reforms and climate rules, as well as the Obama approach to the economy and the war on terror. But Trump represents just as dramatic a change from the way politics has been practiced in the TV era, upending every assumption about what is a gaffe, what is disqualifying and what you just can’t say if you want to sit in the Oval Office and represent an entire nation. If he uses tonight’s debate to brag about his genitalia, or invite the Russians to hack his opponent, well, it won’t be normal, but it won’t be the first time, either. And yes, even though she’s unlikely to put it this way, Clinton represents the status quo—not just a continuation of Democratic policies, but a continuation of the conventional rules of politics. She’s playing the same classical music that previous candidates always played, and it wouldn’t feel so stilted if her opponent hadn’t started playing experimental honky-tonk. The question for 2016 is whether Americans are so disgusted with politics as usual that they’ll turn to the politics of Trump. That question will be decided not by the thousands of Americans who flock to Trump rallies or the hundreds who get invited to see Clinton, but by the millions who will tune in tonight even though they would never attend a political event. But the question beyond 2016 is what will happen to politics as usual. Americans never liked it, and Trump has helped expose how cautious, contrived, and anodyne it can be. But he has also helped remind those of us who have complained about it for a living that if caution, restraint, premeditated choreography, and other hallmarks of traditional campaigning aren’t the most authentic elements of successful political leadership, they’re part of it. And while politics as usual does have some bogus Kabuki theater qualities, it also reflects some baseline values—showing basic respect to political opponents and people who aren’t like you, staying at least close to the boundaries of plausible facts, recognizing that the things leaders say and do and tweet can have serious consequences—that have constrained politicians in a good way. It’s not clear whether it will be possible to put the norms Trump has shattered back together, and while we may not have liked them, we might miss them when they’re gone. Not many of us would be better at our jobs if we felt unrestrained from saying whatever popped into our head whenever we wanted. And Trump just may have untied the tongues of the politicians of the future.",true
"From the Daily Caller News Foundation: Teachers at a school in Texas might be armed and are willing to use whatever force needed to protect students, according to a sign posted outside the school district. Medina Independent School District placed a sign in front of one of its entrances Sept. 14 to warn people that teachers might be armed, reports CNN. “Please be aware that the staff at Medina ISD may be armed and will use whatever force is necessary to protect our students,” the sign says. The warning serves as a good way to drive away potential threats, according to the school’s superintendent. “I think that anybody who might have a thought about harming someone in mind might think twice about it,” Superintendent Penny White said, according to KSAT 12. “We’re 20 minutes or 25 minutes from Bandera. That’s our closest law enforcement.” White and Dr. James Lindstrom, a school board member, said no specific event spurred the sign, Lindstrom added it was posted due to the “the general environment nationally.” Jillian Sides, a mother with two sons at the school, thought the sign was a good way to keep away threats. “Schools have been a target for, for lack of a better word, crazy people, and I’m perfectly fine with it,” she told KSAT. Another mother disagreed, believing the sign could bring trouble. “I don’t know if that’s asking for trouble or not. I mean, you post a sign like that, it may bring trouble, unfortunately,” said Alisha Reagan, a mother of a third-grader. White would not name the teachers, if any, who are armed. The school plans to post two additional signs at other school entrances.

"KENT, OHIO—A lonely Hillary supporter stood with a sign outside the rec center at Kent State University on Saturday, a gray and muggy afternoon for a rally. “INSECURE, SMALL PENISED WHITE GUYS FOR TRUMP!!!” his sign read. Near him, grizzled men in fatigues and sunglasses and a fraternity brother held pro-Trump signs. But the main swirl of activity ahead of Bernie Sanders’ speech in this Ohio college town was the dozen fervent Jill Stein supporters, formerly fervent Bernie supporters, holding signs and signing up volunteers. “We have a better choice,” one sign—puffy paint on rumpled printer paper—said. “The two-party system is messed uuuup!” sang Patty Friedrich, a local Green Party organizer, as she pranced around, handing out fliers to people going to the rally. “Embrace the suuuuuck!” Story Continued Below “I think our democracy is over after this election,” said Kristyn Nye, who works in marketing. “It doesn’t matter who wins.” Bernie had opened her eyes, she said, and when he left the race, she was bereft of choice and angered by his speech at the Democratic National Convention in July. “He should’ve just dropped the mic,” Nye said. “I wish he would’ve just stuck it to them. What does he have to lose? People in Vermont love him!” After a rally in Akron, Bernie Sanders had arrived in Kent on a mission that might be critical to the election: coaxing disaffected Ohioans not just to vote, but to vote for the woman whom he’d been calling corrupt just a few months ago. With Donald Trump moving up in the polls—and even, according to some polls, leading in this crucial swing state—the Clinton campaign sent in the reinforcements: Bernie Sanders. Hillary for America, which organized the event, was evidently hoping that Sanders, with his anti-establishment appeal and image of fiery authenticity, could bring his herd—and maybe a few stragglers—more securely into the fold. But it was not clear how well it was working: Nye had internalized Bernie’s message so fully that she had decided to vote for Jill Stein, the Green Party candidate. She was for Jill mostly because she disliked Hillary, who voted for the war in Iraq, is constantly surrounded by scandal and, in Nye’s view, “doesn’t stand for anything.” She also may or may not have Parkinson’s. “But I know a person with Parkinson’s, and I don’t know how she would be able to control the shakes,” Nye muses out loud. “She would have to be on so many drugs that she’d be so out of it, but she seems sharp. How does she do it?” Maybe she just doesn’t have Parkinson’s? I offered. Nye blinked at me, not understanding. “She’s just so untrustworthy, that I just don’t know,” she finally responded. “Is it pneumonia?” And another thing, Nye said. Clinton wants to start a war with Russia, which she heard on Russia Today. When I pointed out that this was a channel paid for exclusively by the Kremlin, she wondered how that was any different from, say, NPR. She wasn’t going to the rally inside the rec center to hear Bernie speak, and neither were the other Bernie diehards there that day. “Why? To hear a man who sold his soul?” said Michele Bline, 54, a disabled veteran of Desert Storm. “Bernie sold ooouuuut!” sang Friedrich nearby. “They threatened his familyyy!” “We’ve heard it all before,” Bline went on. “We know where he stands,” “He’s not going to sway me,” a grad student named Gwen West chimed in. Inside, past the humming treadmills and clanging weights, on the far edge of the basketball courts, walled off from the dribblers and dunkers by a wall of semi-transparent white netting, Sanders stood slouching over the lectern, his rumpled pants falling on clunky black shoes, holding forth to a crowd of about 300. A Sanders rally of yore this was not. Earlier that day in Akron, only about 150 came out to hear the old prophet of political revolution. Here, he tried to fulfill his promise to do whatever he could to prevent Trump from being president. To cheers and finger snaps, he talked about the man’s bigotry and “the so-called Bertha movement.” “Now let me be very clear about what the Bertha movement really is,” he went on in his Brooklyn accent about the faux controversy Trump spawned about Obama’s provenance. “It’s not about disagreeing with Obama—you can disagree any time you want. What they were trying to do, led by Donald Trump, is to delegitimize the presidency of the first black president we have ever had. ... What an outrage! What a racist attack!” “This is an enormously, enormously, enormously important election,” he pressed on, the crowd beaming up at him. “And for those of your friends who say, ‘Well, I don’t like anybody, I’m not going to vote’ ... ask your friends why the Koch brothers are spending hundreds of millions of dollars if this election is not important.” It took him a while to get around to saying it, but he did: “Hillary Clinton believes as I believe” that the minimum wage must be raised, that women should control their own bodies, that “our gay brothers and sisters have the right to get married.” “You have to do everything you can to make sure that Secretary Clinton and [Democratic Senate candidate] Ted Strickland win in this state!” Afterward, he was mobbed for handshakes and selfies. “Did you get to shake his hand?” Lorie Sewell, a local teacher, asked her husband Jim. “Twice!” Jim grinned. They had voted for Bernie in the primaries and were still fans, but, said Jim, who teaches at Kent State, “there was no convincing necessary” to get them to support Clinton. He went on, “We would’ve rather voted for Bernie, but the choice is pretty darn clear.” Three freshmen, Samantha, Quincy and Molly, were exhilarated by the various media interviews they had given after the rally, and their parents—it was parents’ weekend—waited patiently until they could get a bite to eat. The girls were all ardent Bernie supporters—and one of their dads was, too—but they liked Clinton fine, too. Their parents had supported her, and it was a natural switch for them. “I was always going to vote for Hillary if Bernie didn’t win,” Samantha said. Nearby, three young female students, two of them black, told me they had voted for Bernie but were willing to support Hillary in order to keep Trump from being elected—which, one of them laughed, would usher in “World War 17.” They weren’t huge fans of Hillary and her “sketchy” history, but they understood the stakes and Sanders’s lobbying for her was compelling. “Bernie’s supporting her,” Kelyanne, a junior, said, “so there must be a side of her that’s good that we just don’t see.” There was a small commotion in the wings—the student volunteers were meeting privately with Bernie, who thanked them for their support and took a group photo with them. Afterward, two of them, both College Democrats who had voted for Bernie in the primaries, gushed about that moment. “He had his hand on his shoulder!” Brian DiPaolo said, pointing to his comrade Anthony Erhardt. They still loved Bernie, but the switch hadn’t been wrenching for them either. “I was never a Bernie-or-Buster,” said Erhardt. “It was not hard” to watch Bernie concede in Philadelphia and pass the baton to Clinton. “It was a celebratory moment,” he said. There are still some things on which Erhardt disagreed with Clinton, but ultimately, he said, “the pros outweigh the cons.” “I’m voting for her because she’s more qualified,” DiPaolo said matter-of-factly, clearly proud of the maturity of his reasoning. “I like to say that we’re not selling out, we’re buying in.” Sure, they had some friends who were holding out and planning on sitting out the election—all the students I talked to did—and they just hadn’t bothered to even come see Bernie that afternoon. This struck them all as “selfish” and “self-centered” and the people outside, the Jill Stein supporters, are “just doing harm to Bernie’s image.” Or, as Erhardt put it, “I love Bernie, I still do. I just hate his supporters.”",true
"ORLANDO — Tim Kaine and Mike Pence are both feeling more pressure to perform in their own vice presidential debate after Monday's caustic contest between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Kaine spoke to Clinton shortly after, disclosing to a crowd at a Democratic field office here that his running mate's debate chops raise expectations for Kaine to match her. Story Continued Below ""Man, you've really raised the bar. You put the kind of pressure on me that I like to really help my debate next Tuesday,"" Kaine recounted telling Clinton in a speech to field organizers here. Pence expressed similar sentiment, saying on Fox News he's been dusting off his Capitol Hill experience to get ready to go toe-to-toe with the Virginia senator. ""Donald Trump raised the bar for his running mate last night,” Pence said. From there, however, the two vice presidential hopefuls' assessments diverged. Pence said that Trump took ""command"" of the stage while Kaine likened the GOP nominee to a heavyweight prizefighter on the verge of quitting. ""If you're that rattled in the debate, try being president,"" Kaine said. ""Donald Trump was up on the split screen like a boxer ready to go down on a TKO.""

"The window is rapidly closing for the White House to publicly hit back at Russia over a suspected Kremlin-backed cyber campaign to meddle in the U.S. election process, according to a vocal cadre of lawmakers who are hammering the Obama administration over its silence on the matter. The lack of any open retaliation, they say, is giving Russian hackers free rein to manipulate the election process in the final lap of the campaign season, sowing further doubts about an electoral system that GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump frequently bashes as “rigged.” Story Continued Below “I’ve been very surprised the administration hasn’t done something about it,” said Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I think it’s a very serious problem. This isn’t a small matter. It’s an historic matter. No one has ever been allowed to monkey around with our electoral system.” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a frequent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, lamented that the White House is tiptoeing around the hacks “because of this obsession they have with not offending Putin because of Syria and other things.” “If [Russia] did do it,” Graham added, “the Obama administration won’t do a damn thing about it.” Numerous former Obama administration officials acknowledge that the longer the White House waits to unveil any response, the more political scrutiny the move will receive, given Democrats’ allegations that the Kremlin is using its vast hacking apparatus to tilt the election in favor of Trump over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. “It’s harder to do the closer we get to the election,” said Timothy Edgar, who served in the first Obama administration as the director of privacy and civil liberties for the White House national security staff. And some lawmakers and policy experts believe waiting until after Election Day to strike back publicly means missing a chance to stem the tide of digital assaults on election targets. “You can’t deter after the fact,” said Adam Segal, an international cyber policy expert at the Council on Foreign Relations. But officials are constrained by competing priorities that could take precedence over shaming Moscow for the hacks, which have compromised top Democratic political institutions as well as senior government officials on both sides of the aisle. Any response could put the final nail in the State Department’s already faltering efforts to negotiate a Syrian ceasefire agreement with Russia, spark a tit-for-tat cyber war between Washington and Moscow and potentially expose valuable espionage tactics at a time that the U.S. government is reportedly ramping up its digital snooping on Putin’s regime. And many on both sides of the aisle, as well as former officials, cautioned that moving swiftly on public finger wagging, economic sanctions or criminal indictments — the three most likely types of official responses — may have little actual deterrent effect before the election. “You know that countries conduct espionage on each other,” Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) told POLITICO when asked if the White House needed to issue an overt response. “You understand that, right?” House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) believes such public responses can establish an impossible mandate to identify hackers after every major breach. “I think that’s the danger in all this,” he said. “If you start to name someone, well, you’re going to have no shortage of people to name, and in a lot of cases it’s not attributable.” The first of this summer’s election-themed cyber intrusions — at the Democratic National Committee — probably led to July’s mass leak of 20,000 internal emails that appeared to show the party’s favoritism for Clinton over her presidential rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). The message dump forced the resignation of DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Later, hackers released the personal contact information of nearly every Democratic House member and staffer after another digital break-in at the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Elsewhere, suspected Russian hackers have also targeted Clinton campaign staffers’ personal emails, left-leaning advocacy groups, Democratic state officials and potentially even voter registration databases. According to media reports and numerous former officials, the Obama administration is probably far along in its investigation into the attacks. U.S. intelligence officials already have “high confidence” that Moscow is involved in the spate of hacks, according to anonymous federal officials quoted in The New York Times. On Thursday, Feinstein and House Intelligence Committee ranking member Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said they had heard enough in their briefings with officials to conclude that Russia is to blame. “We believe that orders for the Russian intelligence agencies to conduct such actions could come only from very senior levels of the Russian government,” the pair said in a joint statement. The remarks broke with other lawmakers — even those like Graham — who have cautioned against accusing Russia before authorities make an official determination. “I very much hope the president will respond,” Feinstein told POLITICO. “In my mind, there’s no question that the Russians have been poking around in our various systems.” Lawmakers across the political spectrum have echoed Feinstein’s call for a response — regardless of who is responsible. “We need to take action,” Senate Foreign Relations Committee ranking member Ben Cardin (D-Md.) told POLITICO. “It’s not just naming, it’s … using the tools we have available to make it clear we won’t accept that type of behavior.” But with little more than six weeks to go before Election Day, the administration's choices may be limited. Preparing criminal indictments for the hackers responsible can take months, even years. The DNC hack was revealed only in June, kicking off the slate of intrusions and leaks that are still ongoing. In the last few weeks alone, suspected Russian-linked hackers have posted personal information on Democratic donors, revealed internal House race strategy memos from the DCCC and leaked the personal emails of former Secretary of State Colin Powell and an apparent White House staffer. “If the process is governed by the criminal investigation, I don’t see that you’re going to have any response by the election,” said Michael Zweiback, a former chief of the cyber crimes section of the U.S. attorney’s office in California’s Central District. Conversely, the administration has previously shown it can swiftly prepare economic sanctions following major hacks. It only took five weeks for the White House to announce sanctions on North Korea in retaliation for the bruising hack that temporarily disabled Sony Pictures Entertainment in late 2014. Whether similar sanctions could have a tangible deterrence effect on Russian hacking is debatable, though, even if such a move would help establish international norms in the long run. Christopher Swift, a former official with the Treasury Department office that oversees hacking-related sanctions, cautioned that Russia’s economy has already had two years to adjust to the strict international penalties slapped on the country in response to its military action in Ukraine. Additional sanctions may not be “adequate” to alter Moscow’s immediate decision-making, he said. Russian state-backed hackers often don’t work for the Kremlin in an official capacity, making them even more insulated from sanctions, added Swift, now a national security professor at Georgetown University. Many on Capitol Hill have simply pressured the Obama administration to publicly blame Russia for the hacks if the investigation finds it culpable. “The deterrence aspect of cyber response is very, very important,” said Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.), who chairs a Senate Armed Services subcommittee that oversees cyber threats, during a recent hearing. “Public responses make an impression, as well.” But cyber policy experts and former Justice Department and White House officials concede that any response before the election will have unpredictable ramifications on the presidential campaign trail, just as campaigns are entering the last leg of the race. “No matter what they do, people are going to try and politicize it,” said Chris Finan, former White House director of cybersecurity legislation and policy. “I don’t know that they can completely insulate themselves.” “Both candidates are going to be asked what their position is and what should be done about it,” said Ed McAndrew, a former DOJ national security cyber specialist. “I think that the response, unless it is a strong response, is going to create more potential issues than it’s going to solve, and that [is] certainly so for the candidates.” The White House is also boxed in by the shaky deal the State Department tried to reach with Russia to reduce violence in Syria. State is also working with Russia to enforce the wide-ranging, controversial agreement reached with Iran last year to reduce its nuclear capabilities. The State Department is one of several agencies — including the Justice Department, Defense Department and the National Security Agency — with a key voice at the table advising the White House on its response to the election hacks. Given the sensitive situation, some forces within State are probably more hesitant to prod Moscow over other issues at the moment, agreed former officials from multiple agencies who have been involved in similar deliberations. The State Department has as much ability to “throw up the red flag” as any other agency, said Edgar, the former White House cybersecurity official, who is now a visiting fellow with the Watson Institute of International and Public Affairs at Brown University. Most cyber experts and lawmakers — even those who favor a public retaliation — accept that Russia would retaliate in-kind for any public move the White House makes. “You never know how they’re going to respond,” Cardin said. “One thing is that you can’t take them for their word.” Some suspect that a recent online dump of apparent classified NSA hacking tools was meant as a sly message from Moscow to Washington: We’ll reveal your espionage secrets if you mess with us. “We need to be prepared for the Russians’ public response,” said McAndrew, the former DOJ cyber specialist. “And it might be a tit-for-tat, it might be [Russia publicly revealing our operations].” But to those who favor public retaliation, the Obama administration can’t let these factors sway them from acting — and acting soon. “I think we still have some time,” said Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), who has called on the Foreign Relations Committee to hold a hearing on the issue. “If you have an opportunity to forestall further meddling by sending a deterrent signal and making the Russians feel some pain … I think the administration has an obligation to do that irrespective of politics,” Finan said.",true
"The liberal media jumped on the story of Keith Lamont Scott, an “unarmed” black man who was shot in cold blood by North Carolina police. His only crime was holding a book and waiting to pick up his son from school. What a heartbreaking story. It’s a shame for the liberal narrative that it’s not anything close to the truth. Not only did reports conflict with the story of Lamont’s girlfriend (a woman also recording the event from about 20 feet away), but new body cam footage released by the police clearly show that Scott had an ankle holster and was holding a weapon. This coincides with the officers’ numerous orders for him to drop the gun. This also coincides with Scott’s previous convictions for assault with a deadly weapon and carrying a concealed weapon. Here’s definitive proof of Scott holding the gun, according to a user on Twitter: Can we put the debate to rest now? pic.twitter.com/aniW2yxwje — Quake Gyan (@QuakeDawg) September 26, 2016  And a more detailed analysis of the newest video by political commentator and popular YouTuber, Mark Dice.  It’s clear that the liberal media doesn’t care about what actually happened. It’s clear that they’ll gloss over the fact that he had a gun and previous convictions for assaulting people with concealed weapons. The only thing that matters to them is the justification for rioting and the race-baiting tactics that keeps black people and white people at odds for political gain. It’s disgusting, and America is better than this.

"(CNN)The fate of several dead American ISIS hostages quietly came back to the forefront at a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing Thursday when a member asked Defense Secretary Ash Carter to find a way to bring their bodies home. Sen. Joe Donnelly brought the issue up amid growing talk by military commanders about using Kurdish and Arab forces to push ISIS out of Raqqa, the terror group's stronghold in Syria and self-declared capital. The US believes several of the US hostages murdered by ISIS likely were killed in the Raqqa area and their bodies have never been recovered. ""When we go to Raqqa, we lost some young men and women there who were killed by ISIL, and we want to have them come home, "" said Donnelly, an Indiana Democrat, using another word for ISIS. ""We don't want to leave anyone behind. And we would ask for your cooperation and assistance,"" he said to Carter. Donnelly specifically mentioned Peter Kassig, an aid worker killed in November 2014, and Kayla Mueller, another aid worker ISIS held, tortured and then claimed died in an airstrike. The US believes the American hostages, including journalist James Foley, were killed by the now-dead ISIS operative known as Jihadi John. ""All the parents and all the folks back home, we want them all to come home. And we'd sure appreciate your assistance in making that happen,"" Donnelly said. Carter answered ""noted."" The military is aware of the families' desires, but also knows how very tough that job may be, one defense official told CNN. The US military has a long history of trying to recover the remains of dead Americans. Recently the bodies of two American civilians who fought and were killed with militia groups fighting ISIS were returned to the US. And fallen service members missing on foreign battlefields are still being searched for from the Vietnam and Korean wars, as well as World War II. The US also searched for years in Iraq for the Scott Speicher, a downed Navy pilot from the first Gulf War, until his remains were recovered in 2009. But whether the remains of the hostages can be located, identified and brought home may be very difficult the defense official said. It's widely believed there are a number of burial sites around Raqqa and without some confirmation of where the Americans are buried it may be too sensitive to begin removing remains. ",true
"Washington (CNN)New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is wrong in his assessment of stop-and-frisk, a policy that allows police officers to stop and pat down individuals they deem suspicious. ""Donald Trump talks about stop-and-frisk like he knows the facts,"" de Blasio told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""He has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety."" Trump touts stop-and-frisk practice amid black outreach ""He should really be careful because if we reinstituted stop-and-frisk all over this country, you'd see a lot more tension between police and communities,"" added the mayor, a Democrat who is supporting Hillary Clinton for president. If elected, Trump said Wednesday at a Fox News town hall that he hopes to take the controversial policy nationwide to help stem ""violence in the black community."" ""One of the things I'd do ... is I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to,"" Trump said. ""We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically."" Trump's comments came in response to an audience member's question about reducing ""black-on-black crime."" But many people in New York's black community have opposed the practice arguing that New York's police disproportionately used the policy to target and harass people of color. After ongoing protests of the policy, a federal judge ruled in 2013 that the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy violated citizens' constitutional rights. However, the judge did not order an outright ban on the practice, but called for outside oversight and reform. The city under Mayor Michael Bloomberg appealed that ruling, but those efforts were dropped under de Blasio's administration, and the city is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process, which is supervised by a federal monitor. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated whether New York City is appealing the federal judge's 2013 ruling on stop-and-frisk. The city appealed the ruling at the time, but has since dropped that effort and is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process. ",true
"Another day in “Obama’s America”… another RIOT. This kind of crap is becoming our norm, and it’s not right.

SO…there is a fatal police shooting and now, the Police are under full attack, reporters are getting rocks thrown at their head, innocent bystanders’ are getting their vehicles bashed up and set on fire….and yes, stores are being looted. Free ipads and laptops for EVERYONE! Because they are grieving that someone has died, the country is against them and stealing stuff they wanted but never could get…makes it all better right? Imbeciles. This is no stand they are taking at all. No..this? This is what ‘stupid’ looks like when it takes human form.

However, that’s not all… She made a desperate call to Police, but by the time they were able to arrive, the damage had been done. For all she knew when she called her life was in danger, and that is exactly the kind of fear she was faced with. It ticks me off. Who do they think they are, right? …but worse, where the HELL is Obama?   I’ll tell you where… He’s laughing. At you, at me, and at all the stupid liberals who think he cares about hope and change.

"Weirdest thing, United States Immigration made a mistake. Just kidding it’s not weird, in fact they just caught themselves making 858 mistakes when they mistakenly granted citizenship to immigrants who had pending deportation orders from countries of concern to national security or with high rates of immigration fraud. Oopsie. Don’t worry government everyone makes mistakes and it’s only OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AT RISK!!!!! I mean c’mon guys, this isn’t like accidentally leaving the onion on a burger when the customer says ‘hold the onion’. A human being and their paperwork is much larger than a burger. Homeland Security Department’s inspector general found that these particular immigrants used different names and birthdates and their fingerprints were missing from the database. The report does not identify any of the immigrants by name, but Inspector General John Roth’s auditors said they were all from “special interest countries” — those that present a national security concern for the United States — or neighboring countries with high rates of immigration fraud. The report did not identify those countries. DHS officials identified an additional 953 people who had been naturalized despite outstanding deportation orders, though auditors couldn’t determine if those immigrants had digital fingerprints on file or not. Roth’s report said fingerprints are missing from federal databases for as many as 315,000 immigrants with final deportation orders or who are fugitive criminals. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has not reviewed about 148,000 of those immigrants’ files to add fingerprints to the digital record. The biggest danger in mistakenly awarding citizenship to someone who should be deported is that as a US Citizen they would be able to apply for jobs that require security clearance. So far 3 of these mistaken ‘citizens’ acquired aviation and transportation credentials. A 4th person had become a law enforcement officer. For now immigration and DHS are scrambling to fill the holes in the files and implement a system to evaluate each case of the immigrants improperly granted citizenship. ",true
"President Obama prides himself on his legacy for African Americans. He often touts his south side of Chicago childhoods as some type of rags to riches story. Despite the fact that he really grew up all over the world including in the Phillipines. You’ll often hear him discussing how his presidency has helped to quell racial tensions. Despite the fact that they are at an all time high as seen in Baltimore, Milwaukee, Charlotte, New Orleans and more. Democrat’s in general have had a very loyal demographic voting base in African Americans, women and Hispanics. Groups of people the party routinely targets during the election. But just because most vote blue doesn’t mean they all do. Now some minority citizens are expressing their outrage with President Obama and his legacy and spreading it all over Twitter.

"  After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter’s apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton’s apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past. The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type. Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary’s stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does. Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself. The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates? What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton. The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In. It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity. If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential. The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

"Tony Stewart is still fighting to remain in the Chase, and so far it doesn’t look very promising. Tony Stewart has had an interesting season to say the least. What started out not very promising thanks to a back injury has now turned into him being in the running towards a championship. Over the years Smoke has been involved in many controversial things. From being accused and admitting to wrecking people intentionally to being involved with a man being hit on the track, resulting in the end of his life. Overall, Tony has seen some pretty harsh things. And that can take a toll on a guy. However, he still manages to give back to people in the most amazing ways!  In a recent event, it looks like Smoke’s giving saved a life. According to a racing team first responder, Jay Masur, Tony Stewart’s lending of equipment saved his life. Masur has been a first responder for years. He’s seen first hand just how dangerous racing is. He’s also been in instances where Tony Stewart is the one he’s responding to. Now it looks like the roles have reversed. Masur was responding to an incident on a dirt track when he lost control of his four wheeler, causing him to fly off into the air and on the ground.  Now you may be wondering where Tony Stewart fits into all of this. A few years before this incident, Masur responded to one of Smoke’s wrecks and reportedly saved his life. That’s how Tony felt at least. So after everything was said and done, Smoke bought Masur and his team top of the line equipment. That equipment, including a helmet, is what Masur claims saved his life. “I believe I swerved to miss something and flew off the four wheeler and ended up hitting my head pretty hard. I believe this helmet probably saved my life, there’s no doubt. We all feel like, we’re bullet proof, we all feel, in the jobs we do, it can’t happen to us, because we’re pretty good at our stuff, but no matter how much we prepare, how much we plan, things happen, and at the end of the day, love your family, treat every day like it’s the last day on earth, because it may be. We saved [Tony’s] life and I truly believe he had a huge part in saving mine.” WOW! That’s amazing. Tony has yet to speak out about this incident, but we can only imagine how he feels. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Jay Masur and his family as he continues to heal from this incident!   ",fake
"Hillary Clinton says that Christians are bigoted and deplorable. They are discriminator using ‘code talk’ in her opinion. You know how liberals decry stereotyping of groups? That does not seem to slow them down in their treatment of conservatives and Christians. Oh, and they are homophobic and Islamophobic as well. Geez. Read more below!  As Written By Ken Klukowski for Breitbart: Hillary Clinton: Christians are Bigoted and Deplorable, ‘Religious Liberty’ Code for Discrimination. Christians across America should be terrified by Hillary Clinton’s denouncing of Trump supporters as “bigoted” people who are so “deplorable” that they are “irredeemable,” because she was primarily talking about people of faith, as reflected by one of her top Democratic supporters just one day before Clinton’s infamous speech. While many commentators were stunned by Clinton’s comments, most have overlooked the setting and context. Clinton was speaking in New York City at an LGBT event. And she specified that the “bigoted” and “irredeemable” people she was denouncing are both homophobic and Islamophobic. Observant Christians in 2016 are repeatedly called bigoted and homophobic for holding to biblical teaching and church doctrine that marriage is between a man and a woman, that sexuality should be expressed only between married couples, and that a person’s sex is part of how God deliberately made them, and is something they should embrace. These leftists also say that these observant Christians are anti-woman because believing in protecting the life of the unborn is a form of “discrimination.” Clinton’s charge of Islamophobia was broadly cast against Americans who raise concerns regarding what certain segments within Islam—not all Muslims, but rather those who adhere the versions that embrace violence and jihad—believe and whether this should…..

"Washington (CNN)With two months to go before Election Day, Democrats have the cash advantage in the race for the White House, but Republicans have the cash advantage in the race for the Senate. Presidential campaigns and their supportive super PACs filed new numbers Tuesday that continue to show Clinton's cash lead in the homestretch of the presidential race. Clinton's campaign raised $59.5 million and had about $68 million on hand at the end of August; Trump's raised $41.7 million and had $50.2 million on hand. Meanwhile, a cadre of Republican donors -- most prominently, Sheldon Adelson -- are keeping Republicans competitive in down-ballot races. Here are the five takeaways from the money race: Hillary Clinton is very dependent on a few billionaires Under-noticed in this campaign have been the very few Democratic billionaires who are responsible for Clinton's advertising machine: Priorities USA. The super PAC had a record-breaking month, collecting $23.4 million during summer's dog days. The bulk of the money is from a select few: Fred Eychaner and Daniel Abraham, who gave $3 million each, George Soros, who donated $2.5 million, Don Sussman, who kicked in another $2 million, and Laurene Powell Jobs, whose LLC contributed another $2 million. Those five people are responsible for a majority of the money that Priorities USA has raised, and their names have littered Democratic campaign finance reports for the entire 2016 race. Trump doesn't have donors of similar sizes, and that's why his super PACs have failed to keep pace. Only one new name appeared on Trump's PAC's reports: Cherna Moskowitz, who gave $1 million to a group run by close Trump allies (and billionaires) Bob and Rebekah Mercer. What's Clinton's money good for? Ads Clinton has enjoyed a fundraising advantage over Trump for the entire campaign, and it's allowed her to build an organization that Trump could not. The Democratic nominee spent almost $50 million last month -- way more than she spent during any other month -- and that's due to $33 million in ""media buys."" That's more than six times as much as they spent on payroll costs. And her campaign, joint fundraising committees and Priorities USA had $194 million on hand, meaning plenty of more ads are coming. She's still struggling with small donors: only $8.4 million of the money she raised last month if from donors who gave $200 or less. Trump is finally raising the big bucks Despite record spending in the month of August -- including a hefty amount on its digital firm -- Trump still entered the month with over $50 million on hand. Trump collected $12 million from small-dollar donors who gave directly to his campaign, and he himself added another $2 million to his own bid. $20.2 million came from his joint committees with the Republican National Committee. Trump finally began advertising in the month of August, and it's reflected in his campaign finance report. He spent almost $30 million last month, $11.5 million more than he spent in any other month. The return of Mike Bloomberg The former New York City mayor remains the most prominent political donor who hews to the center of the political aisle. His super PAC, Independence USA, has primarily focused on supporting candidates who support restrictions on firearms, and has emerged as a leading backer of Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey. But he personally is backing the Democratic ticket for president. The billionaire last month made his largest donation yet to his group: another $8.5 million from his personal fortune. That's his largest check ever to the super PAC. Senate Republicans have the upper hand Thanks to $21.5 million from the Adelsons, groups backing Senate Republicans have more to spend in the homestretch than do those backing Senate Democrats. The Senate Leadership Fund, an allied group in New Hampshire, and the Koch brothers' super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, raised $32.5 million in August. That also doesn't include various groups that aren't required to disclose their donors, such as the US Chamber of Commerce or other Koch nonprofit groups. And the Democrats? The main Senate groups -- Senate Majority PAC, Emily's List and the League of Conservation Voters -- took in only $20.5 million. Environmental activist Tom Steyer on Tuesday pledged another $15 million to his joint effort with labor unions to develop a coordinated ground game for the Democratic ticket. But here's what we do know now: The Democrats don't have an Adelson equivalent. Their main Senate donor last month is Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, who along with his wife gave $5 million of the $20 million he has pledged to spend in 2016. In the Senate cash race, Adelson is a game-changer. ",true

"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump held a “town hall style” meeting in Cleveland Heights with the alleged goal of discussing “African-American concerns,” strangely hosted by Sean Hannity via Fox News. The only problem: Hardly any African-Americans attended. Former Digital Director and Deputy Director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Brandon English noted on social media today the noticeably white audience attending Trump’s event.

The literature said “When Christians don’t vote we lose our voice,” implying that the election’s results will decide “Whether or not Religious Liberty is protected.” As English noted, 42% Cleveland Heights is black, and yet well over 95% of the town hall’s attendees appeared to be white.

"Well over 80 million people tuned in to see Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump face off, setting a new record in the sixty year history of televised presidential debates. According to Nielsen, the debate averaged a total of 84 million viewers across 13 of the TV channels that carried it live. Many millions also watched the debate via live streams on the web. Nielsen's 84 million total counts people who watched via traditional TV channels at home. People who watched the debate at parties, bars, restaurants, and offices were not counted. Neither were C-SPAN viewers. This means the actual total audience is even higher. On the TV side, CNN and other cable news channels saw big increases over past election years. So did the broadcast networks. NBC had the biggest audience overall, partly because ""NBC Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt was the moderator of the debate. Upwards of 18 million people watched the debate on NBC. ABC drew 13.5 million viewers, CBS drew 12.1 million, Fox News drew 11.4 million, CNN drew 9.9 million, the Fox broadcast network drew 5.5 million, and MSNBC drew 4.9 million. The debate was also a hit on Spanish language television, attracting 2.5 million viewers on Univision and 1.8 million on Telemundo. Trump may have been the ratings magnet, but Clinton may have been the beneficiary of the ratings bump. By Tuesday there was a media consensus that Clinton had prevailed in the debate. The debate viewership number to beat was 80.6 million, set back in 1980, when Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan debated just once before the election. More recently, the first Obama-Romney debate in 2012 averaged 67 million viewers. Detailed Nielsen data confirms that viewership stayed high the entire time. Contrary to some speculation, there was not a big drop-off after the first 30 minutes of the 98-minute debate. The vast majority of viewers kept watching until the very end, a fact that the Clinton campaign celebrated on Tuesday. Earlier story: Ratings expectations for first Trump-Clinton debate are sky high Anticipation for the Clinton-Trump meeting had been mounting for months. Television industry executives were anticipating a total audience somewhere between 80 and 100 million. There will be two more debates between the candidates in October. On Monday night Twitter said the first face-off was the ""most tweeted debate ever."" Given the rapid growth of streaming options, it was almost certainly the most streamed debate ever, as well. Various live streams on YouTube together registered more than 2.5 million simultaneous viewers. Live streams on other sites also reached millions of people. On both Twitter and Facebook, Trump was a livelier subject than Clinton. Twitter said the ""final share of conversation around the candidates on stage"" was 62% for Trump and 38% for Clinton. On Facebook, the results were even more lopsided, with Trump earning 79% share of conversation and Clinton having the remaining 21%. Being talked about isn't necessarily a good thing for a candidate. Most commentators gave Clinton the edge over Trump after the debate. Still, the post-debate coverage on TV focused on Trump, partly because of surprising and confounding comments he made on stage. CNN's reality check team investigated 26 claims made by Clinton and Trump and found that Trump made a greater number of misleading statements.",true
"This is a true story.  General Stanley McChrystal was the Commander of US Forces in Afghanistan and he had frequent disagreements on the conduct of the war with his Commander-in-Chief. At one point McChrystal was called into the Oval Office and he knew his Army career was about to be over. When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren’t going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. “It’s not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it’s my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,” McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.  Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve.  He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance. Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal’s resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. “I bet when I die you’ll be happy to pee on my grave.” The General saluted. “Mr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I’d never stand in line again. Good job General McChrystal.  I’m pretty sure that after five or six years of being in the ground the line will have diminished enough so that you won’t have to stand in line.  You’re an honorable man, we know you wouldn’t cut in front of others.",fake

With polls showing high voter anxiety over terrorism, Trump took the first shot on the subject early in the debate, with a charge that Clinton's web site had posted details of her war plan. ""You're telling the enemy everything you want to do,"" Trump said. ""No wonder you've been fighting ISIS your entire adult life."" That was a head-scratching claim, given that Clinton is 68 and the Syria-based group, also known as ISIS, has only existed in its current form since 2014. (A predecessor group was founded in 2004.) But Clinton ignored Trump's puzzling assertion. ""At least I have a plan to fight ISIS,"" she quipped. Clinton later added that while Trump has claimed he has a ""secret plan"" to fight ISIS, ""the only secret is that he has no plan."" Clinton took more seriously his charge—supported by many national security experts—that the 2011 U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq had enabled ISIS's creation. ""They wouldn't even have been formed if you left some troops behind, like 10,000, or maybe something more than that,"" Trump said. President Barack Obama oversaw the exit of U.S. troops, which he celebrated at the time. Clinton was then serving as Obama's Secretary of State. But she countered that it was the George W. Bush administration which failed to reach an agreement with Iraq's government that would have allowed U.S. forces to remain in the country on terms acceptable to Washington. ""George W. Bush made the agreement about when American troops would leave Iraq, not Barack Obama,"" Clinton said. ""And the only way that American troops could have stayed in Iraq was to get an agreement from the Iraqi government that would have protected our troops—and the Iraqi government would not give that."" Experts have debated that point for years, with some claiming that Obama never really wanted such an agreement and didn't try as hard as he could have to secure one. Yet some some former Obama officials—including the U.S. ambassador to Iraq at the time of the withdrawal, James Jeffrey— say that Clinton argued internally for maintaining a troop presence in the country beyond 2011. ISIS evolved from the group al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), founded in the wake of the 2003 U.S. invasion of that country. The group was nearly wiped out by the U.S. military but regained strength after the American withdrawal, and as it joined the fight in Syria's civil war. In 2014, AQI cut ties to al Qaeda and renamed itself the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, and is often called the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS. There is almost no expert support for Trump's longtime insistence, which he repeated Monday, that the U.S. should have seized Iraq's oil fields as a form of war booty, and that doing so would have allowed the U.S. to prevent ISIS's rise. ""Had we taken the oil—and we should have taken the oil—ISIS would not have been able to form either, because the oil was their primary source of income,"" Trump said. Trump has argued for years that the U.S. should commandeer Iraq's oil, though he has not addressed basic questions like how many troops it would take and how the oil would be transported from a country sure to be hostile to the seizure of its most valuable commodity. Nor did Trump ever describe the plan in the past as a way to prevent militants from flourishing, even as many national security experts were doing so. Clinton, who cast a Senate vote to authorize the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2002, sought to turn Trump's talk of Iraq history back against him by citing his well documented comments in favor of the U.S. invasion before it happened. ""Donald supported the invasion of Iraq,"" she said. ""I did not support the war in Iraq. That is a mainstream media nonsense put out by her,"" Trump said. Trump proceeded to claim he had ""numerous conversations"" with Fox News host Sean Hannity, in which he opposed the war, but of which there is no public record. The debate's moderator, Lester Holt, endorsed Clinton's version of events. ""The record shows otherwise,"" he told an irritated Trump. As he often has before, Trump again cited an August 2004 interview with Esquire as evidence of his opposition to the war. ""They did an article in a major magazine, shortly after the war started, I think in ‘04, but they did an article which had me totally against the war in Iraq,"" Trump said. But by that time, more than a thousand American troops had died in Iraq, photos documenting the Abu Ghraib prison abuse scandal had emerged, and public support for the occupation was falling fast. Clinton reiterated her pledge to ""intensify"" airstrikes against ISIS, enlist technology companies to track down on the group's Internet activities, and support Arab and Kurdish fighters on the ground in Iraq and Syria—largely steps the Obama administration is already taking. Clinton did not repeat her past talk of establishing a ""no-fly zone"" in northern Syria. Clinton also raised the subject of Russia, pressing her campaign's recent charge that Trump is suspiciously respectful of Russian president Vladimir Putin and that he holds Kremlin-friendly views of NATO and Ukraine. ""There's no doubt now that Russia has used cyber attacks against all kinds of organizations in our country, and I am deeply concerned about this. I know Donald is very praiseworthy of Vladimir Putin. But Putin is playing a very tough, long game here,"" Clinton said. Defying the strong consensus view of U.S. intelligence officials, Trump cast doubt on Russia's alleged role in the recent hack and exposure of Democratic National Committee emails. ""I don't think anybody knows it was Russia who broke into the DNC. She's saying Russia, Russia, Russia. Maybe it was. I mean, it could be Russia, but It could also be China, but it could also be lots of other people,"" Trump said. ""It also could be someone sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, OK?""",true
"Kittens love saucers of milk and dogs love — what? Bones, of course! Do you give your dog bones? Many do. After finishing a good T-bone, why not give Fido a treat too, right? According to veterinary charity, the PDSA, owners should stop giving their dogs bones as they assert that bones may actually be killing dogs!   The organization says that splintered bones could be damaging the digestive system of dogs and that many dogs have had to undergo surgery to repair the damage or address blockages caused by the bones. They said that cooked bones pose the greatest risk of splintering, but that raw bones pose dangers as well. Rebecca Ashman, a senior vet with the PDSA, said: “Surgery is usually needed to remove any blockage and in some cases, the damage is so serious that it can be fatal. Similarly, if they swallow a large piece of rawhide chew this can become stuck and cause serious problems.” We all love to see our pets happy, but it may be time to find new toys for the pooches to chew on. A wagging tail is nice, but being sliced up or blocked by bits of bone seems like a particularly nasty ordeal. What do you think? Wil you heed the advice? Or is the concern overblown? ",true
"Protests erupted overnight Tuesday into Wednesday in Charlotte, North Carolina, after a police officer shot and killed an African-American man while looking for another person who had an outstanding warrant. According to local reports, police officers saw Keith Lamont Scott getting out of his car while holding a gun. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Scott posed an imminent danger to officers, and Officer Brentley Vinson, who is also African-American, shot the man. Story Continued Below ""As is standard procedure with any officer involved shooting, Officer Vinson has been placed on paid Administrative Leave,"" the police department said in a statement Tuesday night. Protesters gathered near the scene of the shooting, an area near the campus of the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Footage from the protests showed people shouting “Black lives matter,” “Hands up, don’t shoot” and “No justice, no peace.” A reporter with a local NBC affiliate posted a video of a journalist injured by a rock hurled in her direction, as the police department deployed its civil emergency unit. At 10:46 p.m., the department’s official Twitter account said that an officer “sustained injuries in an attempt to deescalate agitators during demonstration.” Approximately 12 officers were injured during the protests, according to a later tweet from the department early Wednesday morning. The latest incident comes on the heels of another police-involved shooting in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last Friday that claimed the life of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed 40-year-old man.",true
"Donald Trump is planning a ""national call day"" to Republican donors who've yet to open their wallets, hoping to close a massive fundraising gap between him and Hillary Clinton. Trump is summoning his top fundraisers to Trump Tower on Tuesday, the day after he squares off with Hillary Clinton in the first presidential debate. The fundraisers are being asked to ""prepare call lists of prospective donors"" and to recruit at least three people from their home states to raise funds on Tuesday, according to a copy of the invitation. Story Continued Below Two people briefed on the event said it would be geared toward attracting the support of Republican contributors who have yet to commit to Trump financially. Many of the party's top donors have expressed profound reservations over Trump's candidacy and have chosen to direct their funds to down-ballot races. The push comes amid mounting concern that Trump, who has lagged in the fundraising race, is being outspent and out-organized in the states that will determine the election. Hillary Clinton has outspent Trump on the TV airwaves by a stunning 7-to-1 margin and in many battlegrounds has dozens more offices and field staffers than the Republican nominee. Through the end of August, Clinton has outraised Trump $373 million to $165 million. Among those still on the sidelines are many of the GOP's biggest donors. Trump suffered a blow this week when Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson revealed that he would be directing $40 million to Republican groups devoted to protecting the party's congressional majorities and just $5 million toward electing the GOP presidential nominee. Adelson had once been seen as a potential major Trump donor and seen as possibly giving as much as $100 million to boost his candidacy. Tuesday's event will be hosted by vice presidential nominee Mike Pence and two of Trump's children, Eric and Ivanka. It is being co-chaired by Republican fundraisers Anthony Scaramucci, a prominent Wall Street investor, and Roy Bailey, a Dallas insurance executive. Bailey has long been close with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, a prominent Trump surrogate and adviser. In the invitation, the campaign says it will offer four invitations to next week's presidential debate to fundraisers who pull in at least $250,000 by Friday.",true
"Bloomberg News reports that the Mexican peso grew significantly stronger after Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton’s powerful performance in tonight’s key first presidential debate, after confidently besting Republican Donald Trump. The “invisible hand” of the market is predicting a Hillary Clinton win after tonight’s debate, and that she’s the only one of the two candidates whose election would keep more jobs in the USA too: The Mexican peso rebounded from a record low, a sign investors may perceive Hillary Clinton outperformed Donald Trump in the first U.S. presidential debate. The currency rose 2 percent to 19.4879 per dollar as of 1:20 p.m. in Tokyo, the biggest gain across more than 140 currencies worldwide, after the debate concluded. Around the world, currency traders, the kind-of-by-the-numbers, bottom line capitalists who Republicans profess to believe in the most, were unequivocal. They awarded victory in the first 2016 Presidential debate to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton by buying up Mexican pesos believing them to be more valuable with a stable diplomatic situation, and by the numbers traders weighed in: “I shall not speculate on whether Clinton won or was Trumped,” wrote Jeffrey Halley wrote market strategist at Oanda Corporation in Singapore, “But clearly, the highest [correlated] currency to a Trump victory thinks she did!” On a practical level, a stronger Peso also means that labor in Mexico will get more expensive for American companies as the exchange rate moves when Hillary does better in polling. Professional currency traders have been betting against the Mexican currency for months to insure themselves against an improbable Republican victory in November, which would set forth a catastrophe if NAFTA is unilaterally cancelled, costing millions of Americans their jobs to appease Trump’s delirious policy dreams. Ironically, this means that a Trump victory would make outsourcing far more attractive since people would depress the value of Mexican pesos, making the cost of hiring even cheaper than today. This also means that a Hillary Clinton victory in November will make Mexico’s currency stronger, which will in turn make it more attractive to our corporations to hire American workers or slow down the rate of outsourcing because of higher labor costs south of the border with a stronger Peso. Voting for Hillary Clinton is now economically certain to be better than voting for her lying Republican opponent, because his racism would literally be self-defeating, and the “invisible hand of the market” would be best held by a Democrat’s steady hand in the Oval Office come January.

"What would you do if you were faced with an angry mob shutting down the stretch of road that you’re on? You approach the group and apply the brakes, wondering if they’ll move for you, but not only do they not make any effort to get out of your way, they start coming toward you. Remembering the Reginald Denny affair, you realize that you’re faced with two options: floor it and risk hurting one of the protesters, or stop and risk them hurting you, or worse.  What do you do? Maybe it was the way I was raised, but I learned that if you feel threatened and you feel as if it ultimately comes down to you or the person who you believe is planning to do you harm, the answer is absolutely, 100% self-preservation. Apparently, I’m not the only one with this set of beliefs. An incident took place on the campus of the Eastern Michigan University that proves that if you try to shut down a road in protest, you do so at your own risk. Watching the video below, you can see that black protesters have completely taken over the street. One small jeep, however, clearly has places to be that aren’t right there at that moment. The driver hits the gas pedal and speeds forward, bumping over a protester. Watch the video below:   In case you were wondering if they were upset about the Charlotte shooting, the answer is “no.” Instead, they were upset about the words “KKK” and “Leave N*****s” painted on the side of the school. The words were removed and the school issued an apology, but it was too late, BLM was outraged. Make no mistake, it’s better to be arrested for running over a protester than to be killed and/or have your property stolen by them because they think they’re entitled to it due to someone painting some mean words on the side of a building. “Better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6,” doesn’t only apply to protecting your home and family, but yourself as well. There is no good reason to stop while surrounded by irrationally angry people who just want violence to come to you and anyone else they deem “guilty” of whatever crime they’ve made up today. What would you do if you were in this situation? Would you stop, or would you put the pedal to the floor? ",fake
"If recent history is any guide for the first debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, the polls will become more volatile in the ensuing days, bouncing around more than during the more stable periods of the campaign. But then the race will return to its normal equilibrium, reflecting largely locked-in perceptions of the two candidates. That's no certainty, though. In a race as close as this one, a debate can alter the trajectory of a race — as in 1976, when Gerald Ford was surging in the polls in the fall but may have seen his momentum stunted by a poor performance in a foreign-policy debate with Jimmy Carter in which the Republican claimed there was “no Soviet domination” of Eastern Europe. Story Continued Below The more frequent outcome resembles what happened in 2012, when Mitt Romney saw his poll numbers swell after a strong performance in the first debate, but fade just as quickly. Same for the 2000 presidential nail-biter, when polls after the first debate showed a brief bump for George W. Bush before returning to an Al Gore lead before the second debate. And in 1984, Walter Mondale cut into Ronald Reagan’s lead after their first debate, but Reagan parried Mondale’s attacks in their second meeting and resumed on course for his landslide victory. The most interesting potential analog to this year's Hofstra University debate might be 1980. Carter and Reagan debated only once that year, with Reagan getting a slight bounce after their debate. But the most consequential part of that campaign might be the candidate who wasn’t on stage: John Anderson, the GOP congressman from Illinois who ran for president as an independent. Carter declined to debate Anderson, so the first-term incumbent skipped the first debate. Anderson had been polling at about 15 percent in mid-September, according to Gallup — but he received only about 7 percent of the vote on Election Day. Support for third-party candidates this year rivals Anderson’s backing: Libertarian Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein are combining for about 10 percent of the vote in likely-voter surveys. (Ross Perot in 1992 also had significant support, but he participated in debates with George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton.) There are some parallels in the 2016 campaign — and reasons to believe the three debates, starting with Monday night's, could be decisive. 1. The race is closer than recent elections. The national polls out on Monday set the stakes: Clinton and Trump are even in a Bloomberg Politics survey, and Clinton leads by 1 point in a Quinnipiac University poll and 4 points in a Monmouth University poll. In the poll averages, Clinton leads Trump by a slim margin: 2.2 points in the RealClearPolitics average, as of Monday afternoon. That’s closer than most recent elections. On the eve of the first debate in 2012, President Barack Obama led Romney by 3.1 points in the RealClearPolitics average, and the Democrat had a 4.2-point lead over John McCain in 2008. George W. Bush led John Kerry by 6 points on the eve of their first debate in 2004. And it’s close in the battleground states, too. In POLITICO’s Battleground States polling average, Clinton has a lead of 5 points or greater in six states: Colorado, Michigan, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin. But the most recent polls in Colorado, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin show a much closer race. Trump, meanwhile, has pulled narrowly ahead in Iowa and Ohio. The two candidates are within a single point in three states: Florida, Nevada and North Carolina. 2. More voters are up for grabs this year. Neither Clinton nor Trump is popular: In both the Bloomberg and Monmouth polls, majorities of likely voters have negative impressions of each candidate. But between the candidates’ poor image ratings and the large segment of voters backing either Johnson or Stein, there’s more volatility in this race than other recent elections. As of Monday afternoon, the RealClearPolitics average showed Clinton at 46.2 percent and Trump at 44 percent in a two-way matchup. (In a four-way matchup, Clinton is at 42.9 percent and Trump at 41.2 percent.) That leaves more voters up for grabs than in recent elections. In 2012, Obama led Romney in the RealClearPolitics average, 49.1 percent to 46 percent, combining for more than 95 percent. In 2008, Obama’s lead over McCain stood at 47.9 percent to 43.7 percent, combining for nearly 92 percent. In 2004, Bush led Kerry, 49.5 percent to 43.5 percent, combining for 93 percent. (In 1980, a pre-debate Gallup poll showed Carter narrowly ahead of Reagan by 3 points, 45 percent to 42 percent, with Anderson at 9 percent.) Both candidates still face enormous headwinds in changing voters’ perceptions of them beginning on Monday night, but there are voters out there who haven’t yet committed to either candidate. 3. A massive audience is expected to watch. Television ratings for Monday night’s debate could challenge the all-time record: the nearly 81 million people who watched the Carter-Reagan debate in 1980, according to Nielsen. The debate is going up against “Monday Night Football” on ESPN — a matchup of two of the weaker teams in pro football: the Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints. But the debate will be on all the broadcast networks and each of the cable-news outlets. (The game will air instead of the debate on the NBC affiliate in New Orleans.) Even ESPN thinks the game won’t be a significant drag on debate ratings, with an executive telling Sports Illustrated “it’s going to be a rough night” for football viewership. If the debate doesn’t outrate 1980, it should still draw more eyeballs than the first debates in more recent elections: The first debate in 2012 drew 67 million television viewers, compared to 52 million in 2008, 63 million in 2004 and 47 million in 2000. Usually, according to Nielsen data, the first debate in a given year outrates the subsequent debates — that’s been true in three of the past four elections. That makes Monday night the best chance for both Clinton and Trump to claim an advantage in a close race. “Maybe two-thirds of the people who vote in this election are going to watch the entire debate,” former Obama campaign manager David Plouffe said Monday morning on MSNBC. “This is an incredible moment for both candidates to speak directly” to voters.",true
"Scratch one big economic worry off the list for Hillary Clinton. Federal Reserve policymakers on Wednesday kept their key interest rate steady, avoiding a potential stock market disruption and putting the central bank on the sidelines until after Election Day. Story Continued Below Fed Chair Janet Yellen also strongly rejected claims lobbed at her by GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump that she is keeping rates artificially low to boost stock prices and aid Democrats. “I can say emphatically that partisan politics plays no role in our decisions about the appropriate stance of monetary policy,” Yellen said at a news conference after the Fed announced its decision. “We do not discuss politics at our meetings and we do not take politics into account in our decisions.” Nonetheless, the Fed’s actions can have significant political consequences. The Federal Open Market Committee’s decision means voters are not likely to see big stock-price declines or a slowing economy before the Nov. 8 election. Clinton is counting on slowly improving views of the economy to hold off a late surge from Trump, who has made dissatisfaction with the sluggish pace of growth a centerpiece of his populist campaign. Stocks rose following the Fed’s announcement. “The Clinton campaign should absolutely breathe a sigh of relief, because the market was just not positioned at all for a rate increase; there would have been total chaos,” said Brett Ewing, chief market strategist at First Franklin Financial Services. “Less drama is clearly good for the incumbent party.” At her news conference, Yellen said she saw improvement in the U.S. economy but little evidence of risky inflation. And she said holding off on a hike could allow more people to come back into the labor force. “We are generally pleased with how the U.S. economy is doing,” she said. “The economy has a little more room to run than might have been previously thought, and that’s good news. And remember that inflation continues below 2 percent.” The move cheered investors who have driven stocks to fresh highs this year in large part fueled by the Fed’s continued easy money policy. Yellen and the Fed also offered reassuring words about the state of the economy while pointing to a possible rate hike in December. “[T]he labor market has continued to strengthen and growth of economic activity has picked up from the modest pace seen in the first half of this year,” the Fed said in its eagerly awaited statement Wednesday. “The Committee judges that the case for an increase in the federal funds rate has strengthened but decided, for the time being, to wait for further evidence of continued progress toward its objectives.” The Fed’s decision on Wednesday is not a complete victory for the Clinton campaign. By declining yet again to raise rates, the world’s most powerful central bank is signaling that it does not believe the U.S. economy is strong enough for even the slightest tightening of monetary policy. The Fed raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade. But it has been unwilling to do so again despite an unemployment rate of just 4.9 percent and warnings that inflation could spike in ways that would be difficult for the Fed to control. The Fed’s target rate is now just 0.25 percent to 0.50 percent, a remarkably low figure this late in an economic recovery that gives the central bank little room to maneuver should a new crisis or recession arise. So the Fed’s move avoids a market meltdown but offers fresh rhetorical evidence for Trump and other Republicans who argue that the economy is extraordinarily weak. “It’s certainly better for Clinton not to have a negative market reaction, but the story here is also that Fed does not have high confidence in continued improvement in the economy,” said Michael Obuchowski of Merlin Asset Management. “And that’s something Trump can talk about, that the economy is so weak the Fed can’t do anything even though it wants to.” The Fed also reduced its outlook for economic growth this year to 1.8 percent from 2 percent while keeping projections for 2 percent growth over the next two years unchanged. Trump has made bashing the Fed a central plank in his presidential campaign, repeatedly blasting Yellen as motivated by a desire to protect Democrats. “She’s obviously political and doing what Obama wants her to do,” Trump said on CNBC earlier this month. “I think she’s very political, and to a certain extent, I think she should be ashamed of herself.” Trump has also said that as president he would replace Yellen, whose term runs until February 2018. And he has ripped the Fed for creating what he has called a “false economy” with high stock prices but only modest wage gains and a very low labor-force participation rate. Yellen pushed back hard on the criticism on Wednesday. “The Federal Reserve is not politically compromised,” she said. “I can’t recall any meeting that I have ever attended where politics has been a matter of discussion. I think the public if they had been watching our meeting on TV today would have felt that we had a rich, deep, serious, intellectual debate about the risks and the forecasts for the economy.” Yellen added that the central bank “struggled mightily with trying to understand each other’s points of view and come out at a balanced place and act responsibly, and that’s my commitment to the American people.” Still, some Fed governors appear to agree with at least elements of Trump’s critique. Three members of the Fed’s policy-setting committee voted against the latest decision, the largest number in two years. These governors argued for a quarter-point increase. Some market observers note, however, that investors have already done some of the Fed’s work by pushing up borrowing costs and generally tightening financial conditions without the Fed having to make an official policy move. “Why does the Fed have to do anything if someone else is already doing the heavy lifting for them?” said David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors. “Why break your back?” As for 2016, Kotok said the decision should be a bit of a boost for Clinton, more because it avoids a nightmare scenario than does much to strengthen the economy. “This at least doesn’t hurt her,” he said. “Whether it actually helps is another question.”",true
"(CNN)Hillary Clinton's campaign manager said Wednesday that the Democratic nominee would implement a set of best practices to prevent police-involved shootings like the ones this week in Charlotte, North Carolina and Tulsa, Oklahoma.

The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer. Mook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities. ""The second piece is to restore bonds between communities and law enforcement, so investing in community policing and making sure that local police have the resources to build the resources in the community to prevent something like this from happening,"" he said. Clinton told radio host Steve Harvey on Tuesday's ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show"" that she plans to speak ""directly to white people"" about implicit bias. Mook said Wednesday Clinton meant she would explain that different ethnic groups are often treated differently in America. ""What she's saying is our entire country needs to do some real soul-searching here. It is clear that the criminal justice system is not treating everybody the same way,"" he said.

"President Barack Obama has given what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. General Assembly, and it was a defeatist doozy on the inadequacy of military power in the struggle against Islamist extremism in Syria and elsewhere. By extension, since the U.S. is the world’s preeminent military power, that would mean our president essentially said we can’t win. Noting the longstanding buildup of militant forces within Islam that have fueled the Islamic State group, Obama cast doubt on the viability of a military solution, The Daily Caller reported. “If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,” Obama said. The president said we must “be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.” While he granted that this process would have a military component, he also referred to “a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won.” Obama recommended that we “pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.” You can watch here; the relevant portion of the video begins at 29:30.  We could be forgiven for wondering how any of this is supposed to work if we are led by liberal politicians who are reluctant to admit the often-obvious link between violence and radical Islam and who are more likely to criticize Christians than jihadists. We also wonder how any of this is supposed to work if we are led by liberal politicians who have so conspicuously failed to “see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.” It’s not going to work as long we call the good guys deplorable and the bad guys a religion of peace.

"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what’s going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist. Oh how wrong they were, and still are. First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn’t a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they’ll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins. The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in. Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they’re flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:  The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers. So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says “America first” it’s suddenly racist. Ok, yeah, that sounds logical. Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. “Floored” by the results, the pollster laments that the “basket of deplorables”, who he previously thought were just a “marginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia”, is too big to ignore. He writes: “This not a ‘basket of deplorables’ who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. “Yes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‘other’ but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.” Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don’t call them “deplorables,” you recognize that half the country is against you. Let’s get this done in November. (Source: Breitbart) ",fake

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg looks on during a press conference | Adem Altan/AFP via Getty By Jacopo Barigazzi 9/27/16, 3:22 PM CET Updated 9/30/16, 11:46 AM CET BRATISLAVA — NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg struck back Tuesday at Donald Trump over the U.S. presidential candidate’s claim that the Atlantic alliance is now fighting terrorism only because of his criticism. “NATO has been focused on the fight against terrorism for many, many years and it’s not a result of the U.S. elections campaign,” said Stoltenberg in a press conference during a gathering of European defense ministers in Bratislava. Trump, who has been critical of NATO and even gone so far as to question the U.S. membership of it, said Monday night in a debate with his presidential opponent Hillary Clinton that he now supported the alliance. “I’m all for NATO,” Trump said. “But I said they have to focus on terror, also. And they’re going to do that. And that was — believe me, I’m sure I’m not going to get credit for it — but that was largely because of what I was saying and my criticism of NATO.” Also On Politico Zoya Sheftalovich Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, defended NATO’s track record of fighting terrorism. “We went into Afghanistan to prevent Afghanistan from becoming a safe heaven for international terrorists,” he said, stressing that it was “our biggest military operation ever.” NATO “has and is playing a key role in the fight against terrorism” and the organization has “stepped up our efforts to support the U.S.-led coalition to fight ISIL.” Stoltenberg also said that NATO’s newly created position of assistant to the secretary-general for intelligence “will also be a tool in our efforts to fight terrorism, to share intelligence.” But he insisted the role is “something which has been planned and discussed for a long time and is not a result of the U.S. election campaign.”  © 2016 POLITICO SPRL Log in to access content and manage your profile.

"Gary Johnson said a Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump presidency would be deeply flawed and shrugged off the notion that he could play spoiler in a tight presidential contest, despite fears among Democrats, in particular, that he’s snatching votes from Clinton. “The people voting for me are voting for Gary Johnson,” the Libertarian presidential contender said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” with George Stephanopoulos. “I take great pride in the fact that I am actually offering an alternative. … Fifty percent of people that are registering to vote are registering as independents. How is it that we can only have two candidates?” Story Continued Below “I’m going to sleep well at the end of all this, giving people a first vote, not a second vote, not a lesser of two evils.” Clinton’s campaign manager, Robby Mook, who spoke earlier on the same program, shrugged off Johnson’s impact on the race. “He’s taking votes from both candidates, but your own poll showed that his numbers are — are dropping,” he said, referring to a new Washington Post/ABC News poll that showed Johnson dipping to 5 percent support. “I don’t think that they’re — that either of the third-party candidates are really going to factor into the head-to-head in this race.”",true
"The Senate on Wednesday backed a $1.15 billion arms sale to Saudi Arabia, even as Congress is preparing to override an expected presidential veto of a different bill allowing 9/11 victims’ families to sue the Saudi government. The Senate voted 71-27 to table, or kill, the resolution from Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) that would have blocked the $1.15 billion sale of Abrams tanks to Saudi Arabia, which the State Department approved last month. Story Continued Below While the vote was unsuccessful, Murphy said his goal wasn’t necessarily to pass the resolution, but rather to press Saudi Arabia on its role in the civil war in Yemen. Riyadh has been accused of killing civilians with airstrikes in Yemen and other human rights violations. “I don’t think the Saudis are interested in continually having a debate about the future of U.S.-Saudi relationship on the floor of the Senate or the House,” Murphy told POLITICO ahead of the vote. “I knew from the beginning that this was not becoming law. My point here is to raise a discussion about the war in Yemen and Saudi behavior in the region that isn’t happening.” Opponents of the resolution — including Republican Senate foreign policy stalwarts like Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) — argued that the Saudis were important allies in the Middle East, despite their abuses in the war in Yemen. “Were this resolution disapproval ever to be adopted, it would further convince the world that the United States is retreating not only from its commitments, but also as the guarantor of the international order,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on the floor Wednesday. The arms sale vote comes at a tense time in U.S.-Saudi relations, as Congress is preparing to override a presumed veto on legislation that also targets Saudi Arabia. The White House plans to issue a formal veto of the Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act, which would allow families of the victims of the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks to sue foreign governments found responsible for them. The legislation, which breezed unanimously through both chambers of the Capitol earlier this year, has long been viewed as focusing on Saudi Arabia’s alleged role in the terrorist attacks. The so-called “28 pages,” part of a 2002 probe that was declassified in July, included some indications that appear to suggest links between a handful of Saudis in the United States and two of the 9/11 hijackers. Some influential lawmakers have shown hesitation about the 9/11 bill and its implications as an override vote became imminent. President Barack Obama has not vetoed the legislation yet; he has until Friday to do so, and McConnell said the vote will be held before senators leave Washington until the November elections. Murphy said it was “unfortunate” the timing of the two bills intersected, arguing they were two separate issues that both happened to deal with Saudi Arabia. “I think there are a lot of people who want to vote — who will vote to override the JASTA veto and then vote against our resolution as a means of balancing their votes out,” he said. “Had our resolution happened at a different time, the vote might be different.” Opponents of the disapproval resolution also made a distinction between supporting the 9/11 bill and supporting the arms sale to the Saudis. Republicans who came to the floor to back the sale tied it to Iran, charging that Iran was on the other side of the civil war in Yemen and that Saudi Arabia was essential as a counterbalance in the region. “You're talking about a body and an idea that is ass-backwards, this is one for the ages,” said Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). “To those who want to vote today to suspend this aid to Saudi Arabia, people in Iran will cheer you on.” The U.S. has played a support role for Saudi Arabia in the Yemen civil war, providing aerial refueling and intelligence sharing. The proposed arms sale to the Saudis includes 153 Abrams tanks, and 20 “battle damage replacements,” likely from their use in the Yemen war. Wednesday vote wasn’t the first time that Paul and Murphy have teamed up to force a vote on a sale to a Middle Eastern ally with a checkered history. In March, the pair forced a vote on the sale of F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan, which was also blocked by the Senate, 71 to 24. Paul’s Senate campaign sent out a note to his supporters ahead of the vote Wednesday, urging them to “#standwithrand” and to sign a petition backing his resolution.",true
"Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani decided to weigh in on future President Hillary Clintonâs ability to perform as President in a worse way than Trumpâs âstaminaâ remarks at the first presidential debate. According to Giuliani, the fact that Clinton is strong enough and loves her husband enough to make things work after he was unfaithful to her is actually a sign of weakness that disqualifies her from being President just as much as That One Time She Coughed and her almost superhuman ability to work hardÂ and power through pneumonia for days before she finally collapses from the unnatural amount of strain she put on her body. âThe president of the United States, her husband, disgraced this country with what he did in the Oval Office and she didnât just stand by him, she attacked Monica Lewinsky,â Giuliani said following Mondayâs debate. âAnd after being married to Bill Clinton for 20 years, if you didnât know the moment Monica Lewinsky said that Bill Clinton violated her that she was telling the truth, then youâre too stupid to be president.â Bill Clinton didnât actually âviolateâ anybody. He fooled around with a woman, who was an adult and consented to everything they did, behind his wifeâs back. While she certainly had the right to be angry, and Americans absolutely have the right to criticize him (he was wrong, but it didnât affect his ability to run the country), to say that she is a weak person for staying with him is absolute bullsh*t. Clintonâs strength is in her ability to forgive, to think of the bigger picture, to make her marriage work in spite of a very, very public affair. Of course, this is the sort of thinking that can be expected from a guy who was Mayor when the planes hit the twin towers on September 11, 2001, yet recently completely forgot about those attacks while he was criticizing President Obama, who paraded his mistress around for all to see, and who told the media he was divorcing his wife before he informedÂ her or theirÂ children. âUnder those eight years, before Obama came along, we didnât have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack inside the United States,â GiulianiÂ said in a speech in youngstown, Ohio earlier lastÂ month.Â âThey all started when Clinton and Obama got into office.â Watch it below: https://twitter.com/asvokos/status/780619672760623104/video/1 ",true
"Donald Trump should apologize for pushing the “unseemly” birther conspiracy regarding where President Barack Obama was born, South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham indicated Tuesday. Trump last week explicitly acknowledged that Obama was born in the U.S., though he went on to blame Hillary Clinton for igniting the so-called “birther” controversy despite no evidence and refused to apologize for questioning the validity of the country's first black president. Story Continued Below “I would apologize,” Graham, a frequent and colorful Trump critic, told Bloomberg Politics on Tuesday. “I think the whole movement was unseemly. I had a lot of distaste for it. No factual basis. I think he would be taking the high ground, but that’s up to him.” Graham referred to the birther conspiracy as a “fringe issue” that he didn’t take seriously and said Trump didn’t do “the country a service by pushing this.” Graham, a former GOP presidential candidate, has encouraged other Republicans to un-endorse Trump and hinted that the next president will likely be a “she,” though he has said he won’t vote for either candidate.",true
"Donald Trump’s White House bid is “a movement, not a campaign,” a new ad released by the Manhattan billionaire proclaims. The 30-second TV spot, announced Tuesday via email by the Trump campaign, is entitled “Movement” and features a string of phrases describing the GOP nominee as a “builder, businessman, success” and praising him for “doing what others called impossible.” Story Continued Below Cutting quickly between video of construction sites, Trump himself and seemingly ordinary American families and children, the video touts the real estate mogul’s campaign as “dreaming big” and “building bigger.” Among other claims, the ad says Trump’s candidacy is “defined by freedom” and “leaving the past behind.” The latter statement from the ad’s unseen narrator is accompanied by video from a 1992 “60 Minutes” interview with Bill and Hillary Clinton in which the former president denied having an affair with Gennifer Flowers, a woman Bill Clinton would later admit to having had a sexual relationship with. “While Hillary Clinton ‘distracts and diverts’ attention away from her horrific record with negative advertisements that lack substance, our campaign plans on promoting the positive energy that has turned Mr. Trump’s campaign into a full-fledged movement,” Trump campaign senior communications adviser Jason Miller said in a statement that accompanied the ad’s release.",true
"(EDITOR’S NOTE: This video contains graphic content that may be emotionally disturbing for viewers.) A video of Keith Lamont Scott’s final moments, filmed by Scott’s wife, Rakeiya, has been made public. In the video, obtained by NBC News, Charlotte-Mecklenburg (CMPD) police officers are seen approaching the car where Scott, a father of seven, was waiting for his child’s school bus to arrive. Rakeiya Scott is heard shouting, “Don’t shoot him! He has no weapon!” while police are heard in the distance shouting at Keith Scott to “drop the gun.” “He doesn’t have a gun… he’s not going to do anything to you guys. He just took his medicine,” Rakeiya Scott said.  After four shots were fired, Scott is heard repeatedly shouting, “Did you shoot him?” And runs over to her husband’s car. “He better not be fucking dead, he better not be fucking dead, I know that fucking much,” Scott said as officers ordered her to come to them. “We are at 9453 Lexington Court, and these are the police officers who just shot my husband,” Rakeiya Scott said. “He better live.” From the angle of the recording, it is unclear as to what led up to the killing of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott. As of this writing, CMPD officers have not released the body camera video of Scott’s death, despite calls from the community and even the New York Times editorial board to release it. Police were on the scene to search for a man with outstanding warrants, who was not Scott. However, Scott was nonetheless shot and killed by CMPD officers who allege he was brandishing a firearm. Scott’s mother, Vernita Scott Walker, told CBS News he was sitting in his car, waiting for his child’s school bus, and reading the Koran, which he did every day. “That’s a task for him every day, so he can be out there to get a special spot,” Walker said.”He sits in the truck and reads his book.”        ",true
"Legendary journalist Dan Rather took to Facebook to give his two cents on tonight’s debate, and his response is a devastating indictment of Republican nominee Donald Trump’s atrocious behavior and obvious inability to stay within the realm of factual reality. Praising Clinton for maintaining her composure in the face of Trump’s aggressive interruptions, he tore into Trump for attempting to force our political atmosphere into a post-truth era and for repudiating the noble values of pluralism and tolerance that our nation was founded on. Ladies and gentlemen, whatever civility once existed in our politics is tonight officially dead. Never in the history of televised debates have we witnessed such a show. And that’s what the Donald wanted. A show. He got it, but will he be seen as the hero or the villain? If you are a fan of Hillary Clinton, I suspect you are thrilled with her poised and confident performance. Perhaps her crowning line was “I prepared for this debate and I’m prepared to be President”. If you are a fan of Donald Trump, his quarrelsome, no-holds-barred approach, often facts be damned, will likely in turn have thrilled you. The question is what does everybody else watching think and how many impressionable voters remain? Taking a snapshot of the debate stage this evening, two candidates behind podiums, each representing one of the major political parties, it would seem to be the latest chapter in our quadrennial dance with democracy. But experiencing the event, in sound and motion, it was of course anything but. From the very beginning, the body language tonight was striking. HIllary Clinton, the first woman ever to be on this stage was calm and substantive. Donald Trump interrupted often and slouched and sneered as he turned to address her. This is what Trump’s fans like about him, playing the alpha male at all costs. Clinton seemed completely unflustered, which is what her fans love about her. How this all plays to the majority of viewers and voters at home will be in the eyes of the beholder. But I was surprised by how much this man who has made so much of the means of television spent not looking into the camera, but preoccupied with his adversary. Trump came across as amped, a pacing tiger ready to pounce on every answer. His Interruptions suggests little regard to the rules. He’s itching for a fight…Wants to swing wildly. Clinton was clearly the policy expert, nimbly jumping from topic to topic, policy to policy. But she was also much more able to paint a big picture than I have seen in times past. I thought she was particularly effective on the issue of race and especially the birther lie against President Obama. She had the facts on her side, but also it was an effective appeal to fire up her base. In the end, more than all of the specifics, I was struck by how unprecedented was the overall tenor – matching that of the campaign. We once held certain truths to be “self-evident” – that “all men are created equal” and “they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.” These were the lofty ideals that served as a rallying cry for the founders of these United States to choose liberty over tyranny. The man who wrote these words, Thomas Jefferson, and his compatriots were imperfect and in some cases deeply flawed men. Yet their idealism fixed a North Star in our democratic firmament that has guided our ship of state ever since, with some very noted moral detours. Now I fear that the tide of progress is rapidly receding with the fierce undertow of a looming tsunami. Our Founders believed in reason and the power of intellect. Donald Trump made clear tonight by his wilful ignorance of important issues that he does not. Our founders feared the accumulation of power, they loathed vanity, and tried to build in protections against the demagogues who would appeal to mankind’s basest instincts. Donald Trump relishes in all of these impulses. For him they are instinctual and a prescription for success. To call Trump a con man, as many have, is a disservice to the art of the con. By its definition a con requires deceit. But Trump has not tried to hide his lies or the sheer unrealistic audacity of his cartoonish policy positions. He has asked the American people to bet on him. The fact checkers will certainly weigh in. The pundits will have their say. But the voters have all the information they need. The judgement is in their – or more accurately our – hands. Rather’s words are poetic and nuanced, mixing biting severity with the civilizing admonitions that forged the American journalistic tradition – values that the modern media have abandoned in their ravenous scramble for ratings. We are lucky to have him as a guiding voice during this time of contempt and division. h/t to Dan Rather.",true
"Former Massachusetts governor and 1988 presidential candidate Michael Dukakis knows a little something about unpredictable election cycles and over-preparing for debates. He spoke to ABC’s Jonathan Karl and Rick Klein this week on the “Powerhouse Politics” podcast and the topic of Hillary Clinton's extensive debate preparation came up. She has reportedly spent the past couple of weeks surrounded by advisers and briefing books, leaving the campaign trail in favor of mock debates. Dukakis advised the Clinton campaign to spend less time preparing for debates on topics she already knows well, because the real winner of the election would be, in his opinion, the campaign with the strongest field organization. “This is not the first time you’ve done this,” Dukakis said of Clinton, noting that most political debaters have had years of practice. “And sure, it’s very important, but lots of other things are important in campaigns. Including your field organization and the people that are working for you.” He advised Clinton to focus more on dealing with Trump's unorthodox approach to debating. ""You've got to be spontaneous, feel spontaneous. It's going to be interesting to see how she deals with the Trump style,"" he said. In his own campaign 30 years ago, Dukakis, who was the longest-serving governor of Massachusetts, had a 17-percentage-point lead over Republican presidential nominee George H.W. Bush after the Democratic National Convention. By the second presidential debate, held at UCLA, he came off to voters as unfeeling when responding to a question about the death penalty and his wife. CNN's Bernard Shaw asked, “Governor, if Kitty Dukakis were raped and murdered, would you favor an irrevocable death penalty for the killer?” When Dukakis responded instantly, “No, I don’t, Bernard. And I think you know that I’ve opposed the death penalty during all of my life,” reporters and voters were shocked. He cited the inefficacy of the death penalty, but the public saw his response as cold. He told Klein and Karl on ""Powerhouse Politics"" that he found the question fair, and didn't realize how he had done in the debates until someone else told him later. He cited his own over-preparation as the reason for this second debate flop. In this case, his logical and formulaic response did not prevail over the show of emotion that spectators were expecting. In the end, Clinton’s main challenge and focus should be on persuading voters to truly evaluate their opinion of Trump, he said. “This guy has no business being president of the United States,"" he added.

"What exactly is the point of the FBI? I know what they say they’re supposed to do, but what is their actual purpose? I mean, if you tell them and you know that someone in your family is engaged in terrorist activity and it coincides with the rise of ISIS and they do nothing, what are we paying them to do exactly? I hope they feel terrible about themselves and what’s more, I hope they are ordered to pay the medical bills of the victims, as well as the pain and suffering and lost wages. What is the point of the government telling us “see something, say something” if when we see something and say something, nothing comes of it until the attempted murder of American citizens?  Ahmad Khan Rahami, the man who is being accused of creating and/or detonating hidden IEDs in New York/New Jersey, was captured by police. Afterward, it was revealed that his own father had reported him to the Federal Bureau of Investigations in 2014 for “being a terrorist” according to The New York Times. Two years before Ahmad Khan Rahami went on a bombing rampage in New York and New Jersey, his father told the police that the son was a terrorist, prompting a review by federal agents, according to two senior law enforcement officials. The father made the statement about his son being a terrorist to New Jersey police in 2014, when Mr. Rahami was arrested after a domestic dispute and accused of stabbing his brother. The information was passed to the Joint Terrorism Task Force led by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Newark. Officers opened what is known as an assessment, the most basic of F.B.I. investigations, and interviewed the father, who then recanted. It is thought that the father only made the comment out of anger at his son, but it was very clear that he knew something he didn’t actually want the FBI to investigate. Is the father also accountable for his son’s actions for recanting a statement that was clearly true and putting decent, hardworking Americans at risk? Or is this just on his son, who was the actual creator and distributor of the explosive devices? In my opinion, there’s enough blame to go around. Obviously, the actual terrorist himself receives the bulk of it, but I also would like to point my finger at the father who (it would seem) hid what he knew about his son’s activities and the FBI who didn’t continue the investigation.

"In the first half of the debate, Donald Trump seemed bogged down by some very distracting sniffles. After peddling for weeks a lucrative conspiracy that Hillary Clinton is too sick to be Commander-In-Chief, one must ask themselves why Trump couldnât stop sniffling. Is he sick? Was he holding back tears (after being pummeled by Clinton)? Howard Dean, former head of the DNC and presidential candidate, has a more unconventional answer: he was on drugs. Dean, who is now a contributor forÂ MSNBC, tweeted last night: Notice Trump sniffing all the time. Coke user? â Howard Dean (@GovHowardDean) September 27, 2016 Trump supporters took to Twitter to express outrage, completely forgetting that their preferred candidate spent weeks fueling sexist attacks against Clinton and her stamina abilities. But hey, get offended when Dean points out what could be the obvious. After all, Trump did protect a cocaine trafficker from serving proper jail time by pulling some strings in the justice system. And considering he hasnât released any medical records, who knows what adverse effects drugs (if he does them) has done to his body and mental state. Of course Trump denied he was sniffling, even though the rancid sounds were heard by millions of watchers across the country (and the globe) and the Republican nominee denies that he is sick. So that begs the question: what else could it be. Deanâs assertion is just that â an assertion. It has no factual ground to stand on, but it is ironic to see how Trump supporters react when a conspiracy is made againstÂ candidate. Perhaps they (and Trump) will think long and hard before trying to paint Clinton as anything sheâs not. If this debate showed one thing, itâs that Hillary came out on top and Trump is not happy about it. Why not have a little fun at his petulant behavior? Howard Dean is. ",true
"Washington (CNN)A federal judge on Friday ordered the State Department to release some, but not all, of the emails recovered from Hillary Clinton's private server by the FBI ahead of the presidential election in November. DC District Court Judge James Boasberg said the department must process 1,050 pages of emails between now and November 4, releasing any non-exempt documents aside from those that are determined to be duplicates of those already released. It is unclear exactly how many pages the State Department will have to release as part of that order, but it is expected to be significantly fewer than 1,000 pages. That's because a ""substantial number"" of the recovered documents are duplicates or near-duplicates, a Justice Department attorney representing the State Department said in court. The State Department has appraised approximately 15,000 documents recovered by the FBI, believed to have been sent by or to former Secretary Clinton while she was in office. Of those, over 9,400 have been deemed personal and therefore not subject to release, the attorney said, while approximately 5,600 are believed to be work-related. Production will begin October 7, with subsequent releases October 21 and November 4 -- four days before the election. The State Department will then process 500 pages of the remaining documents per month until all have been released. The order by Judge Boasberg comes as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit brought by the conservative legal watchdog group Judicial Watch. An attorney for Judicial Watch pressed the judge to order the release of all the relevant records prior to the election. Saying he was sympathetic to the efforts of the State Department's heavily-taxed FOIA division, Boasberg offered his 1,500-page order. ""I think it's important the public have as much clarity as possible,"" Boasberg said, but later quipped, ""sometimes I wonder if there's anything other that FOIA processing going on at State."" The Judicial Watch case is one over over two dozen FOIA lawsuits related to Clinton's emails. In a statement to CNN, State Department Spokesman John Kirby reiterated the State Department's commitment to release the official emails, and said, ""All releasable records and portions of these records will be posted on State's FOIA website.""

"Mitch McConnell is playing hardball — forcing Democrats into a take-it-or-leave-it position on a must-pass government spending bill before funding runs dry at the end of the month. With spending negotiations still stymied at the Capitol, McConnell filed a new short-term government spending measure Thursday that concedes key priorities to Democrats — yet still isn’t enough to get the minority party on board. Story Continued Below Gone is the so-called ICANN provision, an internet-domain issue that had become a top priority for Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and other GOP senators and just got the seal of endorsement from GOP nominee Donald Trump. It also includes some funding for a sweeping opioids bill that was signed into law earlier this year, as well as a landmark chemical safety measure that became law in June. The new spending measure McConnell filed Thursday — which funds the government until Dec. 9 — also includes language already worked out between Democrats and Republicans to deal with additional funding for the Zika virus epidemic. A procedural vote on the measure is slated for Tuesday afternoon, and McConnell used a parliamentary maneuver to block amendments to the bill, ensuring that the legislation he outlined was essentially the only option. “There have been broad requests for a clean continuing resolution. So that’s what I’ve just offered,” McConnell said. “It’s the result of many, many hours of bipartisan work across the aisle.” But Democrats, who have little incentive to agree quickly to a deal that lets vulnerable Republicans leave Washington, say they object to the legislation because while it includes flood aid for states such as Louisiana, West Virginia and Maryland, it doesn’t include money for the long-running water crisis in Flint, Michigan. “To put Louisiana in without Flint is like waving a red flag. I don't get it,"" said New York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the third-ranking Senate Democrat. ""I haven’t counted votes but our caucus isn’t going to like having Louisiana and not Michigan."" It also does not remove language that prohibits the Securities and Exchange Commission from requiring companies to disclose political spending. That is current law, but Democrats have tried to overturn it during the recent negotiations. Democrats also floated a provision related to the Export-Import Bank that would have restored the bank’s full financing authority, but that was not included in the spending measure McConnell filed Thursday. That Ex-Im provision was also important for some Republicans; South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham said he would vote against the short-term funding bill because that language was excluded. “The president does not believe that a short-term budget measure that only exists because Congress hasn’t done their job in the first place should be used to pass ideological riders into law,” White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Thursday, while slamming Republicans for their opposition to the Ex-Im Bank. Yet McConnell's proposal is also starting to drive a rift through Democrats. While some leading Senate Democrats stood firm in opposing the new funding measure, other Democrats began to side with Republicans. Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson, whose home state of Florida has been the nation's epicenter of the Zika crisis, said he would vote in favor of the new continuing resolution because it sets aside $1.1 billion to combat Zika ""with no political riders."" ""While I support the people of Flint, my priority is the people of Florida,"" Nelson said. Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) signaled his displeasure with the bill shortly before McConnell went to the floor to unveil it Thursday afternoon. “We’re in no hurry to go anyplace, OK? We have all a lot of time,” Reid told reporters. “I’ve talked with [House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi], she’s not going to agree to this. The president is not going to agree to this. It’s really unfair to the American people.” During her weekly news conference earlier Thursday, Pelosi said the legislation, “in my view, is not even worthy of a counter. It falls very short.” Maryland Sen. Barbara Mikulski, the top Democratic appropriator, charged McConnell with filing a “Republican-only bill"" and said Democrats would not support the legislation, although details of the measure were still emerging and some senators had yet to review it. House Speaker Paul Ryan, for his part, is trying to project an air of calm, telling reporters that lawmakers in his chamber want ""low drama"" in order to solve the government funding impasse. But Cruz is pressuring House lawmakers to fight on behalf of the Internet domain provision that he championed. ""I am grateful for my Senate colleagues' vigorous support during this debate,"" Cruz said in a statement. ""I encourage my colleagues in the House to continue to stand united to ensure that the government funding bill prevents the Obama administration from permanently undermining free speech on the Internet.""

"Washington (CNN)The first presidential debate broke viewing records Monday, but a number of key Senate Republicans getting grilled over Donald Trump's Miss Universe comments say they either weren't watching or don't have an opinion on one of the night's signature moments. ""I didn't get to see it. I was traveling back from Utah. Stupid plane wouldn't let us tie into CNN. So I felt bad about that. I'm going to talk to them,"" Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch said. ""I didn't see it guys, I was on an airplane,"" Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, one of Trump's former GOP primary rivals, told reporters. Sen. Ted Cruz, who only fully embraced Trump last Friday, didn't want to talk to reporters. ""We put out a statement last night,"" he told CNN, as he ran into the Senate chamber. Those who claimed to missed the debate had it the easiest. As they have all year long, GOP lawmakers have been in a bind as they were forced to confront the latest controversial statement from Trump. Tuesday, the questions were about the debate and his comments about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. Hillary Clinton placed his comments blasting former Machado for putting on too much weight front and center Monday night, and Trump fueled the fire Tuesday morning on Fox News. ""And one of the worst things he said was about a woman in a beauty contest -- he loves beauty contests, supporting them and hanging around them -- and he called this woman 'Miss Piggy,' then he called her 'Miss Housekeeping' because she was Latina,"" Clinton said Monday night. ""Donald, she has a name. Her name is Alicia Machado. And she has become a US citizen and you can bet she is going to vote this November."" But GOP lawmakers who praised Trump's debate performance ducked questions about Machado. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was asked about the Machado and Trump's debate performance, he limited his answer to just: ""On the debate, I thought he did just fine."" House Speaker Paul Ryan, who has openly criticized Trump's remarks he viewed as racist, refused to engage on Machado: ""I'm not going to get into the who said what this morning on a talk show because I didn't see it."" Dodging questions about Trump has become old hat inside the Capitol, since Trump first broke through the field of Republican candidates, and then fought his way to the nomination. Trump's accusation that the judge overseeing the Trump University lawsuit was impartial because he was ""Mexican"" (the judge, Gonzalo Curiel, is from Indiana) -- left lawmakers in a similar lurch this past June. The Trump answers have become almost perfunctory, based on Tuesday's informal survey. Indiana Sen. Dan Coats: ""No comment."" Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander: ""No comment."" Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk, who is in a tough battle to hold his seat, repeatedly said, ""Not going to talk about it."" Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, was one of the only Republicans to weigh in on Trump's Miss Universe comment: ""Well, those are comments I don't agree with."" Other lawmakers had effusive praise for Trump when asked broadly about the debate, but little to say on the specifics. West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito explained that she had been listening to the debate in the car and thought Trump did an excellent job. But when asked about Trump's Miss Universe comments, she said she must have missed that part. Sen. Joni Ernst, who stood on stage with Trump at her ""Roast and Ride"" event last month, said, ""I thought it was good."" But when a reporter tried to ask about specifics, she said, ""That's about all the comments I have. But thank you."" Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina got a question about Trump's answers on criminal justice reform, and said, ""I shouldn't have stopped."" Then Scott got a question about Trump taking donations from the private prison industry and he stood there, mouth shut and smiling. But when asked broadly about Trump's performance, he started talking again. ""About his performance? I think he had high points and low points, and at the end of the day I'm looking forward to the next debate with more high points,"" Scott said, as he searched for an elevator. But when he was asked what Trump's low points were, Scott stood silent for a few seconds, appearing to stall for an elevator.

"A New York judge has rejected a media request to make public the contents of a 25-year-old court file on Donald Trump's divorce from wife Ivana, saying the courts have no business deciding what information could be useful to voters. The New York Times and the Gannett newspaper chain filed a motion to unseal the records, arguing the move was needed to contribute to public debate over the real estate mogul and Republican nominee's fitness for the presidency. Story Continued Below Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Frank Nervo rejected that argument in a ruling released Thursday. ""Were the court to make the confidential records available for journalistic, and thus public, scrutiny, it would impermissibly inject itself into the political process by making the value judgment of what information is useful in determining the present candidate's, or any other candidate's, fitness for office,"" Nervo wrote. ""The court's role in the electoral process is strictly limited to determining whether a candidate complies with the Election Law. The court will not take an action that exceeds that limitation."" Earlier this month, lawyers for both Donald and Ivana Trump filed legal papers opposing the unsealing. The GOP presidential nominee argued that New York's legislature has put divorce files off-limits in most circumstances. His ex-wife agreed, but also contended that since she is not running for office, she should not have to sacrifice her privacy even if the court found an enhanced interest in her husband's actions. Her submission to the court noted published reports alleging that she claimed during the divorce that he had raped her. However, Ivana Trump's brief said that was not her view and dismissed those reports as ""previous misinterpreted statements and allegations.” The judge agreed with Ivana Trump that there was no reason to intrude on her privacy. ""The court is obviously aware that one of the parties, who opposes this motion, is a presidential candidate. The court is also aware that the other party, who also opposes this application, is not seeking public office,"" Nervo wrote. ""If the court were to deprive the candidate party of his rights...on the ground that there may be something in the confidential file that would be useful in determining his fitness for office, that ground does not exist in the case of his former wife, who is not a candidate."" A lawyer for the news outlets, David Schulz, said no immediate decision had been made about whether to appeal. ""We are pleased with the Court's well-reasoned decision and order,"" Trump lawyer Marc Kasowitz said. Nervo's conclusion that judges shouldn't try to judge information's utility to voters is not universally shared on the bench. Several judges handling federal Freedom of Information Act lawsuits seeking information about Hillary Clinton's tenure as secretary of state have cited the upcoming election as a reason to speed release of records held by the State Department.",true
"One of the victims wounded in a stabbing at a central Minnesota mall says the man who carried out the attack showed no emotion and his eyes looked blank. Ryan Schliep, one of 10 people who suffered wounds that were not life-threatening before the attacker was fatally shot, told WCCO-TV that the man ""just walked right at me"" before striking quickly and penetrating the skin of his scalp. ""He looked just blank in the eyes like he wasn't even there,"" Schliep said shortly before being released from a St. Cloud hospital. Authorities are treating Saturday's stabbings at Crossroads Center Mall as a possible act of terrorism, in part because an Islamic State-run news agency claimed that the attacker was a ""soldier of the Islamic State"" who had heeded the group's calls for attacks in countries that are part of a U.S.-led anti-IS coalition. But it wasn't immediately known whether the extremist group had planned the attack or knew about it beforehand. St. Cloud Police Chief Blair Anderson said Monday the attack appeared to be the work of a single individual and there was no sign that the attacker, identified as 20-year-old Dahir Adan, was radicalized or communicated with any terrorist group. President Barack Obama said the stabbings had no apparent connection to weekend bombings in New York and New Jersey. Because Adan was Somali, leaders of the state's large Somali community acknowledged the prospect of a ""long winter"" for their people after the stabbings, but warned not to quickly accept the terrorism connection. ""We cannot give ISIS and other terrorist organizations more air time and propaganda without real facts,"" said Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations' Minnesota chapter. Little is known about Adan, who was identified Sunday by his father, Ahmed Adan, and then by St. Cloud police Monday night. He had only a traffic ticket on his record, was apparently out of work after his job as a part-time security guard ended and hadn't enrolled in college since the spring semester. Adan was wearing a security guard's uniform during the attack. A spokesman for the family, Abdi Wahid Osman, read from a statement expressing condolences for the injured and anyone else who was impacted. ""As we mourn the death of our son, Dahir Adan, who was very dear to us, we are in deep shock as everyone else is in the state of Minnesota,"" the statement said. Federal officials released no new information Monday on the investigation into the stabbing, which was stopped by an off-duty police officer just minutes into it. FBI Special Agent in Charge Rick Thornton has said authorities were digging into Adan's background and possible motives, looking at social media accounts and electronic devices and talking to people he knew. Minnesota has the nation's largest Somali population, an estimated 57,000 people. Both Anderson and Gov. Mark Dayton warned against a possible backlash due to the stabbings, especially in St. Cloud, where Somalis in the 65,000-resident city about 65 miles (104 km) northwest of Minneapolis have spoken about mistreatment in the past. ""I implore the citizens of St. Cloud and the citizens of Minnesota to rise above this incident and remember our common humanity,"" Dayton said. ""It's going to be tough times. We know it's going to be a long winter for this community,"" said Haji Yusuf, who is part of UniteCloud, a local group founded to tackle racial and ethnic tension in the city. Last year, St. Cloud school officials met with Somali parents, community elders and students after Somali-American students walked out to protest their treatment. One student had said Somali-Americans were called Islamic State members and had their headscarves pulled off, and a photo posted on social media of a Somali-American student who was using a wheelchair after breaking her leg with a caption that said she was ""disabled in ISIS."" Five years earlier, CAIR's Minnesota chapter asked for a federal civil rights investigation into allegations that Muslim students had been harassed at two St. Cloud high schools. A 2011 agreement resolved the case, but the U.S. Department of Education still was monitoring the case last year. In 2013, CAIR called on police in nearby Waite Park to reject a training program about Somalis because a flier unfairly suggested the activities of al-Shabab — a militant group in east Africa that has had success in recruiting Somali-Americans in Minnesota — are supported by most Muslims. If the stabbings are ultimately deemed a terrorist act, it would be the first carried out by a Somali on U.S. soil. Adan was employed by the security firm Securitas, and was assigned for a few months to an Electrolux factory near the mall, Electrolux spokeswoman Eloise Hale said. His father, speaking through an interpreter, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that he was 22, but court records and a driver's license database showed his age as 20. Police also said he was 20. A spokesman for St. Cloud State University confirmed that Adan was a student majoring in information systems, but hadn't enrolled since the spring semester. Yusuf, who has spoken with Adan's parents, said Adan went to the mall to pick up an iPhone. Yusuf said Adan seemed happy when left the home, which was the last time his parents saw him. A person at the T-Mobile store where Yusuf said Adan had gone declined to comment or take a message for his supervisor. Five minutes after authorities received the first 911 call, Jason Falconer, a part-time officer in the city of Avon who was there shopping, began shooting the attacker as he was lunging at him with the knife, Anderson said, and continued to engage him as the attacker got up three times. Avon Police Chief Corey Nellis said Monday that Falconer owns a firing range and is the city's firearms instructor. ""If I was going to ask anybody to fire ... live rounds in a crowded mall, I would trust his abilities next to anybody's,"" Nellis said. The mall reopened Monday after being closed Sunday. ——— Forliti reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski and John Mone contributed to this report from St. Cloud, Minnesota, and Jeff Baenen contributed from Minneapolis. ——— This story has been corrected to show that the Electrolux facility is near, but not in the Crossroads Center mall at St. Cloud. It also has been corrected to reflect that Adan's age to 20, rather than 22, and to reflect that Yusuf's group is UniteCloud, rather than OneCloud.",true

"I love a story with a happy ending! When a Palestinian teenager attempted to lure an Israeli soldier into an ambush, the last thing he probably expected was to be shot down before he could carry out his fatal plan. It makes me all warm and fuzzy inside.  If there’s one thing you need to know about Israeli soldiers, male and female, it’s that they are trained to know the moves you are going to make before you even think about making them. They are faced with life and death situations every single day, because they live in the most dangerous area in the world and have been targeted by Palestinians and Muslims around the world for as long as anyone can remember. Apparently this 16 year-old didn’t know what you and I know, and it was the very last mistake he ever made. A surveillance camera captured the 21-second event where Issa Tarayra – as identified by the Palestinian Health Ministry – approached an IDF soldier before attempting to stab him. Forces responded to the threat immediately and put the young man down. Luckily nobody but Tarayra was harmed, as the soldier that was targeted had managed to duck out of the way of the knife just in time. Watch the video below, but be aware that while it’s not extremely graphic footage, it may be considered shocking to some. Viewer discretion is advised:   According to The Daily Mail, this is the ninth attack of its kind since the end of the Muslim holiday Eid al-Adha and ahead of October’s Jewish holidays.

"I…can’t…even. This is absolute madness and as hard as I’m trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can’t wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy. I cannot say that I don’t understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It’s just… is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them. It’s going to blow up in his face. In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore… it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it? You be the judge of that. The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of “all things dangerous” then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It’s not possible. You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair. As if their job wasn’t already hard enough in Obama’s America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being “disproportionately” targeted, they can run. Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either. Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that’s “reasonable suspicion” and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it’s not important to get evidence when it’s fresh, because it could hurt a thug’s feelings. Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve…if there’s a runner. Which…let’s be real, what thug doesn’t run? Punchline: The law abiding ones! I’m so funny.

"NEW YORK — Regardless of who wins this November, the next U.S. president should stand united with Europe against Russian aggression, including Moscow's interference in other countries' elections, Latvia's foreign minister said Monday. Edgars Rinkēvičs' comments to POLITICO come as Americans face two stark choices in the White House race: Republican Donald Trump, who has spoken in friendly terms of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Democrat Hillary Clinton, who has pledged to get tough on the Kremlin. Story Continued Below In an interview on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Rinkēvičs steadfastly declined to say who he'd prefer win the upcoming election — ""The choice of the American people will be made this November,"" he said. ""Whatever that choice is it must be respected."" But he emphasized that U.S. willingness to join Europe in standing up to Russia in recent years through sanctions and other means was a policy that should continue. ""We should understand the kind of values we all share across both sides of the Atlantic are under attack from many actors"" including ""countries that really want to challenge the current state of the world, the revisionist countries,"" Rinkēvičs said. The Latvian diplomat noted that several European countries, including France and Germany, are holding important federal elections next year. Russia is believed to be quietly supporting far-right parties in some European states, including through financial aid. Kremlin-backed hackers also are suspected of staging digital attacks on the U.S. election infrastructure this year. And Russia's state-supported media clearly favors Trump. Trump has said that, if he's elected, the U.S. may not come to the military aid of Baltic states (Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia) if they are attacked by Russia if the three small countries have not paid their fair share to NATO. The Baltics have protested such comments, saying they are increasing their defense spending and pointing out that a common defense is at the heart of the NATO alliance. The Baltic states worry that Russia, which invaded and annexed a piece of Ukraine in 2014, is trying to re-establish the Soviet sphere of influence, including through manipulation of elections. ""We do see that money is often used in Europe,"" Rinkēvičs said of the Russia methods. ""The same sometimes happens with direct and indirect ways this country also tries to influence our internal political life.""",true
"MASON CITY, Iowa — Hillary Clinton’s statement that Donald Trump’s incendiary rhetoric aids ISIL’s cause is a “new low” for the Clinton campaign, Mike Pence said on Monday. “The campaign of insults went to a new low this morning,” Pence said of Clinton’s campaign. “Hillary Clinton actually said my running mate’s rhetoric had been ‘seized on by terrorists.’ … And she said Donald Trump’s rhetoric was ‘giving comfort to our adversaries.’” Story Continued Below “Well, Hillary, strength does not give comfort to our adversaries, weakness does,” Pence said. Pence was referring to comments Clinton made Monday in response to attacks in Minnesota, New York and New Jersey. ""We know that a lot of the rhetoric we've heard from Donald Trump has been seized on by terrorists, in particular ISIS, because they are looking to make this into a war against Islam rather than a war against jihadists,"" she told reporters during a statement Clinton has made this claim multiple times during the campaign. When she first leveled the charge in December, Politifact said there was no evidence for it. But after ISIL used a clip of Trump in a video after the group's attack on Brussels, Politifact updated its assessment, calling the claim true. Pence's comments came on the heels of a radio interview with Rush Limbaugh in which Pence said Clinton is oblivious to the threats posed by terrorism and complicit in weakening U.S. law enforcement. “I’m not sure that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama know that we’re at war,” Pence said. He went on to blame Democrats for a “culture of political correctness that is tying the hands of law enforcement here at home.” Pence spoke to Limbaugh on the phone from his plane on the tarmac in Mason City, Iowa, where he's appearing at a town hall event ahead of a rally in Dubuque. He also slammed White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest for suggesting that the US and ISIL are engaged in a “narrative fight” and took issue with Clinton’s statement earlier Monday that Donald Trump’s fiery rhetoric aids ISIL. “The only thing that gives comfort to our adversaries is weakness,” Pence said. The Saturday explosions in New Jersey and New York appear to be unrelated to the Minnesota attack, officials say. The Minnesota assailant stabbed nine people before being killed by police. ISIL has taken responsibility for the attack. The Saturday night bombing in New York wounded 29 people, while the earlier explosion in New Jersey before a charity race caused no injuries. An Afghan immigrant believed to be tied to the bombings was arrested in New Jersey on Monday after a gunfight with police. “We are at war with radical Islamic terrorism,” Pence told Limbaugh. “We are at war with the ISIS caliphate.”",true
"A border wall isn’t just to keep out illegal immigrants – it acts as a national security measure. China didn’t build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders. We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they’ve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.  And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying… As the Conservative Tribune reported: Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. “Border Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,” he said. “Our agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.” It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs. Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that  “Eight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,” Garza explained. “Unfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.” We need a border and stronger border security – and there’s only one Presidential candidate willing to help with both.

"An anti-Donald Trump super PAC is going on the offensive ahead of the first presidential debate this Monday at Hofstra University in New York. The group, the Not Who We Are campaign, is using students at the very university where the debate will be held to make a point. A new web ad produced by the group features students unfriendly to Trump's message.     “I don’t think you can have a racist bigot as president,” one student says in the 60-second spot that was filmed on campus. Another chimes in, “He makes me terrified.” And a third simply says, “I don’t want him on campus.” The Not Who We Are campaign plans to run the ad on Twitter and Facebook ahead of and during Monday’s debate.   “Since the Donald himself is coming to campus, these Hofstra students are standing up and sending a message that bigotry and hatred are not who we as Americans and not who they are as part of the Hofstra community,” Not Who We Are’s campaign manager Josh Hendler said in a statement. Hendler’s group bills itself as a venue for “community members and leaders across the country” to “organize their friends, neighbors and coworkers to take a stand against” Trump by writing open letters. “We’ll help you craft the language and organize co-workers to take a stand against bigotry and hate,” the group’s website says. The site features letters from companies, universities and groups ranging from members of the clergy to scientists to golfers. One recent letter, written by Hofstra student Rob Bielunas, reads in part: ""As a community, Hofstra has worked to root out racism, sexism, and xenophobia, the very ideas Mr. Trump has used to get where he is today. His hateful rhetoric and complete disrespect for his fellow citizens are why we, as members of the Hofstra community, stand up against Donald J Trump’s run for president.""",true
"As the coal industry and the Obama administration brace for a potentially momentous legal showdown over climate-change policy at a federal appeals court this week, the industry is mounting part of its argument in an unusual venue: on the radio. For the past few weeks, the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity has been running radio ads focused squarely on Tuesday's oral arguments before a 10-judge, en banc sitting of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Story Continued Below ""On September 27th the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has an important decision to make on EPA’s Power Plan. It’s a decision that affects every American’s ability to have affordable energy and jeopardizes every state’s ability to make their own energy policies and it will be a clear violation of the 10th Amendment to the Constitution,"" a serious-sounding announcer declares as ominous music plays in the background. ""It is our duty to uphold the Constitution and say no to EPA’s Power Plan."" A video posted online by the same pro-coal group uses similar language, suggesting a need to take action on Tuesday. “On September 27, it is our duty to uphold the Constitution and the people it is designed to protect,"" the video says. The ads and the video never explain precisely who's being called on to do ""our duty,"" but the EPA plan to limit greenhouse gas emissions from power plants is not going before Congress this week nor is there some referendum. The only people who get to vote Tuesday (or soon thereafter) are 10 of the 11 active judges on the D.C. Circuit. (Chief Judge Merrick Garland has bowed out of hearing cases while his Supreme Court nomination is pending.) Legal ethics rules prohibit lawyers involved in a case from engaging in out-of-court communications with judges under most circumstances. Judges are usually prohibited from initiating or permitting out-of-court contact about a case and are supposed to put such communications on the record when they do occur. The theory behind the rules is that cases should be decided based on written briefs and arguments presented in the courtroom. The American Coalition for Clean Coal Energy is one of the parties challenging the Environmental Protection Agency power-plant rules in the series of cases set to be heard Tuesday during an extraordinary court session planned to stretch for more than three-and-a-half hours, not counting a lunch break. A spokeswoman for the group, Laura Sheehan, said she was not available for an interview Friday. She did not respond to emailed queries about the cost and scope of the ad campaign or the target audience. “The D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals’ decision is critically important as it will either put a halt to EPA’s out-of-control regulatory decision making or give it the green light to continue to run roughshod over states’ constitutional rights,” Sheehan said in a statement posted on the group's website. Prominent legal ethics experts said there's little doubt the ads are aimed at influencing the D.C. Circuit judges. ""They're obviously aimed at intimidating the court into doing what is politically popular, letting the judges know there will be repercussions if they don't decide it the right way,"" said Richard Painter,a law professor at the University of Minnesota and a White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush. ""They're not running these ads aimed at people affected by the administration's position on coal. They're aimed at the judges and their families and friends trying to put the heat on them....This is one more step in the direction of politicizing the courts."" Painter said the ads would be improper if lawyers for the parties before the court were involved. ""I don't think lawyers litigating the case would have anything to do with this. That would be highly unprofessional,"" he said. The ads and online video quote renowned Harvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe saying alarmingly that endorsing the administration's crackdown on greenhouse gas emissions would be like ""burning the Constitution."" The comments come from congressional testimony Tribe offered last year. The group's video actually shows fire appearing to consume the nation's founding document Tribe did not respond to emails asking if he was involved in producing the ads or approved of them. He's set to argue at Tuesday's court session on behalf of coal mining firm Peabody Energy and several others members of the coal-industry coalition running the ads. Some ethics lawyers said the ads are protected by the First Amendment, but may not be a good idea. ""The trade group is engaging in free speech. But it risks annoying the judges,"" said Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University. ""Assuming that risk is unwise because the judges won't be influenced. I bet the industry's lawyers are themselves chagrined by the campaign. The judges are expected to ignore what they may hear just as they are expected to ignore, [such as] an editorial, and decide based only on the record."" Advertising advocating for a specific outcome in a pending court case is highly unusual, but not unprecedented. When the Supreme Court was considering the constitutionality of bans on gay marriage last year, a group of Christian pastors and activists took out a full-page Washington Post ad days before the decision, urging the court not to require states to recognize gay marriage. The court did so anyway, by 5-4 vote. In-person protests related to Supreme Court cases are common, but the court has managed to use its rules to push them off its grounds and onto the adjoining sidewalks. Last year, the D.C. Circuit upheld those rules. The Supreme Court has also upheld a state law that courthouse banned demonstrations near courthouses, even when aimed at judges rather than jurors. The lengths to which the coal industry is willing to go to try to influence the outcome of this week's arguments may reflect the unusually pivotal role the D.C. Circuit could play in the case—one that may wind up being more critical than the Supreme Court. That's because it seems possible, if not likely, that the shorthanded high court could split 4-4 in the case. If that happens, the D.C. Circuit ruling would stand. On February 9, the Supreme Court voted, 5-4, to halt implementation of the EPA power-plant rules until the D.C. Circuit resolves the case and the justices have a chance to decide whether to take up a virtually-certain petition to review that decision. Four days later, Justice Antonin Scalia was found dead in his room during a trip to a Texas ranch. The earlier vote on the stay application suggests it wouldn't be granted if the issue arose today and suggests—although it is far from certain— that the court could divide along ideological lines on the underlying case.",true
"Throughout much of the presidential campaign season, the health status of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has been a hot topic of discussion, largely owing to her several coughing fits and episodes of bizarre behavior, culminating in her near faint and collapse at the 9/11 memorial service a couple of weeks ago. Her health issues were likely a top concern of her campaign headed into the first presidential debate at Hofstra University on Monday, as the presidential debate commission just released clarifications on debate rules that could conceivably work against Clinton. According to the Drudge Report, an unnamed source within the commission revealed that there would be no breaks during the scheduled 90-minute debate, even if Clinton suffers a coughing fit or some other minor medical issue while on stage. “There are no commercial breaks,” the source stated. “Period.” Furthermore, moderator Lester Holt of NBC has zero authority to make cameras cut away from the stage or manipulate the audio microphones in any way, meaning Clinton will have no place to hide from the eyes of potentially 100 million viewers (and voters) if she does suffer some sort of medical episode during the debate. In related news, the debate commission also shot down a request by Clinton’s campaign for a step stool that she could stand on during the debate to help compensate for the immense size difference between her and her Republican rival Donald Trump. Clinton is believed to stand approximately 5’4″ tall, nearly a foot shorter than the 6’2″ Trump, who will no doubt appear dominating in comparison. However, the commission was willing to provide Clinton with a custom-built podium specifically for her that should help to accommodate the obvious size difference between the two candidates. Clinton’s campaign may look at loading up their candidate with whatever drugs they are feeding her on a regular basis to prevent another coughing fit or dizzy spell on stage that would likely ruin any chance she still retains of winning the election. Please share this on Facebook and Twitter to spread the word that the presidential debate will have no commercial breaks or stoppages for Clinton to hide, rest or recover if she happens to suffer another coughing fit or medical episode on stage.

"The suspect in a spate of bombings that terrorized the New York City metropolitan area this weekend visited a city in Pakistan known for being a hotbed of insurgent activity, a source told ABC News. The suspect, Ahmad Khan Rahami, was born in 1988 in Afghanistan and is a naturalized U.S. citizen, according to the FBI. Rahami spent time in Quetta, Pakistan, and Afghanistan during a trip, from April 2013 to March 2014, the source said.     Quetta, a city of about 2 million people, is a known hotspot for insurgents and the reported home of the leadership of the Afghan Taliban. ""If they spent more than a few days, it raises suspicions that while they were there, they will have been recruited by terrorist groups,"" national security consultant Richard Clarke said on ABC News' ""World News Tonight"" Monday, referring to Rahami's travel to the area. A spokesman for the Taliban, Zabiullah Mujahid, told ABC News that there was no link between the Taliban and Rahami.   Afghan and U.S. government officials say they believe Quetta has sheltered the Afghan Taliban's leaders since the U.S. invasion forced them to flee the country in 2002. The Taliban's central leadership council, believed to be based there, is known as the Quetta Shura. Officials say leaders there have planned and directed attacks across the border in Afghanistan and coordinated with terrorist groups like al-Qaeda. The area has a major border crossing that leads to Kandahar in Afghanistan and is reported to be a transit point for extremists traveling in and out of Afghanistan and a hub for illegal trade crossing the porous and largely unsecured border.   Several al-Qaeda militants have been killed or captured in the area, and the United States last year destroyed an al-Qaeda base across the border in Kandahar province that U.S. officials said was the largest militant training camp discovered in the history of the Afghanistan war. Quetta harbors a long-simmering insurgency against the Pakistani government. The city has seen a number of significant violent attacks and bombings, most recently last month, when a blast killed more than 70 people and injured over 100 others. In May of this year, a U.S. airstrike in Baluchistan province, which encompasses Quetta, killed Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Muhammad Mansour. The Pentagon said in a 2014 report that as long as Afghan Taliban forces enjoy “sanctuary” in Quetta and in neighboring border areas of western Pakistan, the Afghan insurgency will persist. Rahami, who was captured Monday after a shootout with police, is being held on charges of attempted murder of a law enforcement officer, second-degree unlawful possession of a weapon and second-degree possession of a weapon for an unlawful purpose.",true
"What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who’ve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that’s the truth in Obama’s America. We’re all aware of the scandal at the Veteran’s Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency. Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported: “We have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,” he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. “Thank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.” Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. “But the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,” said Trump. “He will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he’ll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.” Watch below:  Wouldn’t it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care – a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.  We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans – don’t you think it’s time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield? I can’t imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I’d be tempted to make a medical “error” or two. ",fake
"An exasperated Vice President Joe Biden told the crowd at a Hillary Clinton campaign rally in Philadelphia that “Donald Trump is painfully uninformed” on the issues important to the presidency and expressed disbelief at the GOP nominee’s rhetoric on the economy. “Donald Trump’s is painfully uninformed. No, no, this isn’t for cheering. I want to make an important point,” Biden said, quieting the crowd at Philadelphia’s Drexel University. “And his policies are not very helpful for the country, but what bothers me about this race, and I know I’m sort of a one-man broken record on this, but what bothers me about this race is how palpable his cynicism is about the American people.” Story Continued Below Biden alternated between speaking quietly, jokingly asking rally attendees if they’d seen Monday night’s presidential debate, and raising his voice almost to the level of outrage as he railed against Trump’s past statements on the economy. The vice president slammed the Manhattan billionaire for bragging, as he did Monday night, about not paying federal income taxes, suggesting that such a message did not resonate with hard-working, middle-class Americans. The vice president’s harshest criticism of Trump concerned the real estate mogul’s past statement that the 2007 crash in America’s housing market was good for his business. Of such comments, Biden rhetorically asked the crowd “what in hell is he talking about?” “Look, I’ve been there for eight presidents, Democrat and Republican, I’ve disagreed and agreed. But every president I have served with, including the Republicans, has had a moral center about what it was to be an American,” the vice president said. “Can you imagine Ronald Reagan, the most conservative president we’ve had in a long time, can you imagine him saying, ‘it’s good business to take advantage of people’s misery,’ rooting for that misery? I really mean this. I am not joking. I am not kidding. What does it say about this man?” Biden acknowledged Clinton’s struggles to gain traction with young voters, who polls show are dissatisfied with both major party candidates and have thus gravitated to third-party options like Libertarian Gary Johnson and the Green Party’s Jill Stein. But Hillary Clinton is in lock step with the majority of young people, Biden said, on issues like marriage equality, abortion rights, and reducing the cost of college education. The vice president also told the crowd that he’s spent a significant amount of time throughout this election cycle answering questions from foreign leaders nervous that Trump might win the White House. He said he’s had to reassure leaders from the Baltic states concerned that the GOP nominee might back out of America’s NATO commitments and Australian leaders worried that China’s influence in the Western Pacific might grow under Trump. “Look last night, you got a good look at both the candidates, you saw them both. Hillary demonstrated she’s a leader, she has courage, she cares about the circumstances of the American people, not just the super wealthy,” Biden said. “She thinks everybody should pay their fair share. We simply can’t elect a man who belittles our closest allies, embraces dictators like Putin, a man who seeks to sow division for his own gain and his own benefit, a man who considers bluster and confuses that with strength.”",true
"Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday night warned that the heavily hyped debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is ""not a night of entertainment."" Clinton's former rival and current surrogate made the rounds on the cable news networks as the first showdown neared, laying out the stakes of the contest that has tightened in the last couple weeks. Story Continued Below “I think the hardest part is understanding that despite what the media may think, that this is not a night of entertainment. It's not a Super Bowl. It's not the World Series,” he said. “Tonight, the American people are going to be looking at somebody who will have enormous power in influencing the direction of our country, 320 million people, and the rest of the world. And I hope that we focus on the issues, the differences between the candidates.” Sanders criticized Trump on a number of issues, including tax breaks for the rich, climate change, and his possible choice of Supreme Court justices. “Donald Trump will appoint another conservative,” he said, adding, “Which means that Citizens United, the disastrous Supreme Court decisions that allow billionaires like Sheldon Adelson and the Koch brothers to buy elections and undermine American democracy.” When questioned over his recent comments saying Clinton needs to “get away from this personality stuff” and “start talking about the real issues,” he shot back, “It's not a criticism of her. It's a criticism of the media. Let's talk about which candidate is going to be better for working families.” Sanders said Clinton knows she is up against a skilled showman, saying, “Donald Trump is an excellent entertainer. He's had successful TV shows. That's his campaign. It's entertainment.” Offering advice for Clinton, he continued, “I would say in contrast what she has got to do is focus on the real issues. Stay focused on the issues impacting the American people.” The senator offered more criticism of Trump, taking aim at his divisive rhetoric by saying, “Donald Trump is making the cornerstone of his campaign, in fact, bigotry. Dividing us up. Latinos and blacks, and Muslims. Trying to divide our nation up.” He said that he hoped the candidates would be respectful of each other and that there is an “intelligent debate on the real issues facing the families, working families, of America.”",true
"Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton knows her facts, and during tonight’s debate she busted Trump for his ludicrous tweet calling climate change a hoax by the Chinese. While it’s true that China is a major coal user, America still relies on tons of the dirty stuff, so we’re all in this together. When Hillary Clinton first slammed Trump’s non-scientific pseudo nonsense, so Politifact rated it as “mostly true”: Trump has repeatedly called climate change a “hoax” in speeches, tweets and media appearances, and while he hasn’t necessarily repeated the charge that China “invented” climate change, he has said as recently as Jan. 18, 2016, that action on climate change “is done for the benefit of China.”  He also referred to it with a profanity.

"We’ve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably “read my lips…no new taxes,” a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat: .@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend’s Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO — Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016  Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn’t promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil. Let’s imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. “Destroy” doesn’t leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty “yeeeeehaw,” the reality is that he’s talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He’s talking about profiling Muslims. He’s talking about Donald Trump’s version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn’t just a Muslim, he’s an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he’s a suspect in a bombing doesn’t mean he’s guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked “kill” and not on the most wanted list. There’s nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play. What that means is that under Trump’s dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I’m being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn’t about the narrative. It isn’t about prevention or education. It’s about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening. The only solace we have is that what he’s promising is nothing but another “read my lips.” Terrorism isn’t something you can simply “destroy” just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn’t going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump’s campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons. Featured image from file",fake
"One of former President Bill Clinton’s oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she’s right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state. Dolly Kyle, author of “Hillary the Other Woman,” said Clinton has been “’cruisin’ for a bruisin’,” because she’s so angry and driven by rage. “People like that eventually break down, physically.” “Hillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,” Kyle told WND. “Anyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she’s suffering from real cognitive impairment.” Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks. These symptoms coupled with Clinton’s paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster. “That paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,” Kyle said, and it’s simply not a good combination for anyone — much less the president of the United States. Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton — and Clinton’s health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture. Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants — even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle. “She has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton’s coattails so many decades ago in 1971,” the lawyer said. This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

"To anyone paying attention last night it was clear that Hillary did not win the debate against Trump. Sure, Trump was brash and he’s not your normal politician, but the fact of the matter is he demolished her on her record in front of the entire country. Nevertheless, CNN did their best to make it look like Trump lost the debate by publishing rigged polling data. From Infowars: A CNN/ORC poll released shortly after last night’s debate found that Hillary Clinton scored a clear victory over her rival Donald Trump. One problem – the survey sample included 41% Democrats compared to just 26% Republicans. Asked, “Who do you think did the best job in the debate – Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?”, 62% of respondents said Hillary while 27% said Trump. This immediately gave the impression that Hillary trounced Trump in the debate, and set the standard for the media narrative that it was a bad night for the Republican candidate. However, 33% of the people surveyed in the poll identified as Independents, 41% identified as Democrats, while just 26% identified as Republicans. This represents a disparity of 15% between Democrats and Republicans – meaning the poll was heavily weighted in favor of Democrats before the question about who won the debate was even asked.  Almost three quarters of the respondents were not Republicans and 57% more Democrats were asked than Republicans. If the sampling was flipped, with 41% of respondents being Republican and just 26% identifying as Democrats, the outcome would almost certainly have been in Trump’s favor.              I think you get the point by now…Donald crushed Hillary in last night’s debate! ",fake
"Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold has been doggedly reporting on Donald Trump's charitable record, tracking down everything from $10,000 paintings of Trump paid for by his non-profit foundation to his promised donations to veterans. And in the wake of statements from the Trump campaign personally attacking Fahrenthold, the Post is pushing back. ""The Trump campaign's response to our reporting has been full of personal insults and devoid of any discussion of the facts,"" senior politics editor Steven Ginsberg said in a statement. ""We have reached out to the campaign repeatedly, by phone, email and on social media, and they have yet to answer our questions. We welcome a response that addresses the legitimate questions raised about the Trump Foundation."" The Trump campaign has not responded to Fahrenthold's detailed questions about Trump's donations, but issued a comment late Tuesday after an explosive new report by Fahrenthold showed that Trump used $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaire’s for-profit businesses. In a statement on Tuesday evening, spokesman Jason Miller said the Post, a news organizations Trump had previously blacklisted, has ""gotten their facts wrong."" ""It is the Clinton Foundation that is set up to make sure the Clinton's personally enrich themselves by selling access and trading political favors,"" Miller said. ""The Trump Foundation has no paid board, no management fees, no rent or overhead, and no family members on its payroll. There was not, and could not be, any intent or motive for the Trump Foundation to make improper payments. All contributions are reported to the IRS, and all Foundation donations are publicly disclosed. Mr. Trump is generous both with his money and with his time. He has provided millions of dollars to fund his Foundation and a multitude of other charitable causes.""

"Like much of the mainstream media, the Washington Post is going out of its way to disparage Donald Trump.

"Join the Citizen Journalist Revolution at www.iPatriot.com Terrorism is terrorism, regardless of the source, and two American cities felt the sting of it over the weekend. Is it really that hard to say? Apparently. And if someone on the left does summon up the word, it must always be supplemented with a descriptor. One of two terrorist attacks, a bombing, occurred this weekend in Manhattan, N.Y. “No-one has come forward to admit to planting the device, which exploded in a dumpster,” Cuomo said, but citizens should make no mistake: “a bomb exploding in New York is an act of terrorism.” Got that. At the time he stated (Sunday morning), that no one, or group, had claimed responsibility. Yet he was quick to insist it was not the work of ISIS, or any specific group. However, he also added that, “We’re not going to let them win. They want to make you afraid. We’re not going to let them instill fear.” Okay – so Cuomo admitted he/we don’t know who the bomber is, yet he knows for a fact it is definitely not ISIS, but we can’t let THEM win. If he/we don’t know who the bomber is – may I ask who THEM is? Knowing that even in the face of tragedy, democrats consider everything through a political lens – is the definitely “not ISIS” exclamation by Governor Cuomo a veiled attempt not to tie Obama’s mass immigration of Muslims to the U.S.? I don’t know, but I wouldn’t doubt it. The Manhattan bomber may not be the work of an Islamist, but the attack at a Minnesota mall on Saturday sure was. As I stated, regardless of the source, the two acts were terrorism none the less. It is not hard to say – terrorism, unless you’re NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, who, like many apologists on the left, just couldn’t bring himself to utter the word.

"An officer-involved shooting that took place over the weekend in Tulsa, Oklahoma, has drawn heavy criticism from the usual suspects in the Black Lives Matter movement and their allies in the liberal media. Video of the incident filmed from a helicopter overhead appeared to some to show a 40-year-old unarmed black man named Terence Crutcher with his hands over his head being shot and killed by white police officer Betty Shelby, seemingly confirming the narrative that police routinely use excessive force and deadly violence against black men who pose no threat to them. But according to Tulsa World, evidence was discovered in Crutcher’s vehicle that, while unknown to the officers on the scene at the time, could nevertheless explain some of the man’s behavior that led to the officer feeling compelled to fire her weapon. Inside the vehicle beside which Crutcher was shot and killed was discovered a vial of PCP, a highly dangerous drug that can often create a psychopathic and violent state of mind in its users. In fact, there were numerous anecdotal accounts of individuals on PCP who become nearly impervious to pain, including gunshots, continuing to attack police officers and innocent bystanders alike even as they are being shot repeatedly in locations that would instantly drop an ordinary non-drug using suspect. Another matter that could very well help explain Crutcher’s attitude and actions during the incident was that he had a lengthy criminal rap sheet, including several counts of resisting arrest and prior drug convictions for which he had served time. It is also noteworthy that Crutcher had a warrant out for his arrest related to previous charges of resisting arrest and drug use, so he could have made clear through his words and attitude that he had no intention of peacefully being arrested or returning to prison. All of this is evidence that could conceivably corroborate the view of the officer on the scene who reportedly stated Crutcher looked “like a bad dude” who “could be on something.” It was expected that the medical examiner’s office will release a toxicology report detailing whether Crutcher had the powerful drug in his system at the time of the incident, along with the rest of the broader autopsy report. Please share this on Facebook and Twitter to help spread the word that PCP was found in Terence Crutcher’s vehicle, which may explain why his actions prompted a Tulsa police officer to shoot him.

"Hillary Clinton on Tuesday said she is “appalled” that Donald Trump has not apologized to President Barack Obama after spending years questioning his birthplace. “Everything that I believe in, I want to bring to the White House. I wanna build on the progress that President Obama has made during a very tumultuous time,” Clinton told host Steve Harvey on the radio program “The Steve Harvey Morning Show.” “I mean, I’m appalled that Donald Trump will not apologize to the president and to the country for spending years questioning his citizenship and attempting to delegitimize him. And President Obama and Michelle Obama, they’ve kept their heads high. Like Michelle says, when they go low, we go high. And we gotta stay high. We’ve gotta stay focused.” Story Continued Below Trump on Friday made a much-hyped announcement regarding the conspiracy theory the now-Republican presidential nominee began pushing years ago. His statement, however, lacked an apology and falsely pinned the blame on Clinton for igniting the so-called “birther” issue. “Hillary Clinton started the ‘birther’ controversy,” Trump said, though fact-checkers have found no connection between the conspiracy theory and Clinton or her presidential campaign. “I finished it. Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making the United States great again.” Clinton was itching to hammer Trump during the interview, which began with a remark about the importance of voter registration and the threat of a Trump presidency before transitioning into light topics like what Clinton's and Harvey's grandchildren should call them (Clinton laughed at Harvey’s pitch for what his grandkids should call him — “Big Pimpin’” — and said her granddaughter calls her “Grandma” and former President Bill Clinton “Pop-pop”). “Oh my gosh, can I have the whole hour?” Clinton said when asked what separates her from Trump. “I think it really comes down to our visions and our values. You know, I have a vision where we continue to pursue equality and justice and opportunity for everybody.”",true
"Using Skittles to make a point about ""our Syrian refugee problem"" didn't go over too well with Mars Inc., but the candy maker's rebuke of Donald Trump Jr.'s controversial tweet is hardly a first. The eldest Trump son posted a photo of a bowl of Skittles and a caption that reads, ""If I had a bowl of skittles and I told you just three would kill you. Would you take a handful? That's our Syrian refugee problem.""  This image says it all.

He also didn't remove his Instagram post of Sept. 11, which was meant to be a play on Hillary Clinton's reference to some of his father's supporters as ""a basket of deplorables."" That photo, which he wrote was sent to him by ""a friend,"" replaced images from the movie ""The Expendables"" with pictures of Donald Trump Sr., alt-right conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, alt-right blogger Milo Yiannopolous and other well-known Trump supporters like Gov.

He was the one to cast the convention floor vote for his father that put the Republican presidential candidate over the top and secured him the nomination. Of the three Trump children active in their father's campaign, Donald Trump Jr. was the first to give a speech at the party convention in Cleveland this summer — which was well received by many in the audience.   ""Donald Trump Jr. was so excellent that my brain was already thinking, ‘What should we run him for?'"" Trisha Turner, the president of the New York State Federation of Republican Women, told ABC News at the convention. He has also played a significant role behind the scenes of his father's campaign. Donald Trump Jr. was extensively involved in the vice presidential selection process, even meeting with V.P. hopeful Christie, along with his siblings Ivanka Trump and Eric Trump, without their father present.   In May, Donald Trump Jr. met on his own with Republican officials and the National Rifle Association on Capitol Hill.

"Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.   Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press: Lead #1 – A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device. Lead #2 – A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: “I’m looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.” Lead #3 – A Tumblr page called ‘I’m the NY Bomber’ that claims to be the “manifesto” of the bomber responsible for the explosion that rocked New York City Saturday night. HERE. Manufacturing Test Explosives Hi. You probably have all seen the news by now, the explosives detonated in New York City, that was me. Those were just some tests, I know where I have made errors and I will not make the same mistake next time. I did it because I cannot stand society. I cannot live in a world where homosexuals like myself as well as the rest of the LGBTQ+ community are looked down upon by society. It is 2016 and we are still being viewed as mentally ill, sinners, attention seekers, and just plain weirdos in general. I am not going to stand by while under classed and underprivileged people are oppressed. I am not going to stand by while there is inequality in my country such as the racism being seen in white police officers all over the country. I am not going to live in a country where it is OK to have a misogynist, xenophobic, racist Islamophobic, republican candidate running for President of The United States! That’s implying that republicans in general should even be taken seriously as they are all cisgendered privileged white people. This is not the end, this is just the beginning. I will be remembered. I will make a difference. I will eliminate my targets before it is too late. Someone is lying and it’s just sick that anyone would want to claim this, especially one who didn’t even do it. Trying to benefit off of other’s terror is as base as you can go next to being the perpetrator.   ",fake
"If you’re ever looking for a dose of national commonsense, look no further than the great state of Texas. They are what the rest of the United States secretly wants to be, even California and New York. Governor Greg Abbot has put his foot down on “refugee resettlement” in his state and has made some very simple demands. Want to keep bringing Muslims into Texas? We need better security measures. Don’t feel like implementing such measures? Then we will no longer accept your refugees. Now THAT is leadership!  In a statement obtained by Breitbart, Abbot lays into the FBI and the refugee program. “The federal government’s refugee settlement program is riddled with serious problems that pose a threat to our nation,” Governor Abbott said in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. “The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence have repeatedly declared their inability to fully screen refugees from terrorist-based nations. Even with the inability to properly vet refugees from Syria and countries known to be supporters or propagators of terrorism, President Obama is now ineptly proposing a dramatic increase in the number of refugees to be resettled in the U.S.” I fully expect this same attitude to be adopted by all Republican states that aren’t run by progressives. This is something that needs to be shared across the United States and taken up by the federal government. There is no reason why the people we elected to protect us from foreign enemies should be importing people who could be putting us at risk. Abbot’s reaction wasn’t in response to the latest bombings in the United States, though I’m thoroughly convinced that was at the very least in the back of his mind. Instead, his comments came after the Texas Health and Human Services Commission wrote a letter to the head of the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement. In follow up to our request for approval of our application for an amended State Plan, I write to express the state of Texas’ intentions should you not unconditionally approve our application by September 30, 2016. The 2016 State Plan will no longer be current and continue in effect after September 30, 2016. That date is quickly approaching, and the Office of Refugee Resettlement has not yet approved our application for an amended State Plan. If you do not approve our State Plan as amended by September 30, 2016, we will interpret your silence as a rejection of the application. If our application is rejected -whether explicitly or by silence – the Health and Human Services Commission will be unable to certify that its State Plan is current and in effect, and will exit the Refugee Resettlement Program. We will notify contractors and impacted stakeholders that services and benefits will be provided for 120 days beyond October 1, 2016, or until January’ 31, 2017. America is a nation of immigrants, but we’re not (yet) a nation of idiots. While we should strive to help the people of the world in any way we can, we should not feel obliged to do so if it leaves us open to harm. ",true
"Next week’s debate may be the nation’s most widely watched Presidential debate in YEARS. That is, if both participants actually bother to show up.  Trump-enthusiast and Gateway Pundit owner Jim Hoft published an article today in which he says that an unnamed “conservative leader” contacted him stating that Hillary may be pulling out of Monday’s debate. Now this… A conservative leader wrote The Gateway Pundit Wednesday morning to share this news: Hearing smart guys say that Hillary may cancel the debate on Monday … Hillary may be trying to run out the clock because she thinks she is ahead. Could it be that Hillary Clinton pulls out of the debate, or is this just propaganda for Trump? Or even, a way to garner more interest for the much-awaited debate between the Republican and Democratic Presidential candidates Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton? With the widely-publicized health problems facing the Democratic nominee, it may very well be that she faces a “medical emergency” just before she is slated to take the stage. What do you think is the legitimacy of these whisperings? ",fake
"A 22-year-old Muslim man from Afghanistan proudly declared that he was a superstar in Afghanistan after he sodomized and orally raped a 2-year-old boy. The worst part is that he was only charged with sexual assault and only sentenced to two years in prison. The UK’s Express reports: Jama B., 22, showed no remorse as he was sentenced to just two years and four months behind bars on the milder charge of sexual abuse of the four-year-old boy at the centre in Boostedt, Schleswig-Holstein. The toddler, from Iraq, was lured into a toilet cubicle at the home in March this year. The court heard the Afghani forced his penis into the child’s mouth. Afterwards the distraught youngster was returned to his father with his trousers down around his ankles. During the trial Jama B. boasted: “I’m a superstar in Afghanistan, a singer.” … Judge Stefan Becker refused to comment on the verdict but Peter Boysen, the lawyer who represented the family of the child, said: “it was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child. “Therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. He’s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Jama showed absolutely no remorse for his crime. A second man, Sohrab S., 29, allegedly stood guard outside the toilet during the assault, which was really rape. He was acquitted for lack of evidence. Prosecutor Axel Bieler said, “Rape charges are brought only if it was enforced with violence or the threat of violence. We do not assume this was the case. “Therefore he was indicted on a charge of serious sexual abuse. The penalty doesn’t matter – it is between two and 15 years in jail for rape or for serious sexual abuse.” Say what? How about the fact that it was forced and that it was upon a child? What kind of mind does Axel Bieler have? I can tell you it is not a critically thinking judicial mind for sure. Karin Witt is not better. The spokeswoman of the Kiel court said, “The court found no reasons for an increased penalty, such as for example a criminal record for the accused. “The fact that he was under the influence of alcohol and the high sensitivity towards detention of the offender were both factors in the sentence,” she added. “He is young, knows no German and has already been attacked in pre-trial detention. The victim has also dealt well with the experience of what happened to him and there are no serious consequences to be expected.” What’s even worse is the comments by the family’s attorney. “It was a one-off act that did not take very long and hopefully will not have harmful long-term effects on the child,” Peter Boysen said. “Therefore there is no reason to complain, even if the sentence could have been maybe half a year longer. I have not therefore advised the parents to appeal against the verdict. He’s better again, the boy, but is still in therapeutic treatment of a child and adolescent psychiatrist. Really, Mr. Boysen? How about if this was your little boy? Would you still have the same cold-hearted response at this crime? I think not. Germans were outraged at the charges and the sentencing. “The incredible verdict of the prosecutor and the court,” wrote the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.  “This is the verdict that shames you all.” People continuing to make excuses for criminal sexual crimes, especially for those who are most innocent among us are a part of the larger problem. Allowing the foreign god of Islam in what was once a Christian country is problematic enough. Excusing the pagans that practice the ideology of Muhammad and engaging in these kinds of crimes is just adding fuel to the fire. Don’t think it won’t be happening in the united States either. Our own military kicked out Sgt. Charles Martlandfor defending a boy that was raped in Afghanistan and told other members of our military to keep silent about such abuses. Do you really think our representatives are going to stand up for the children when they’ve allowed them to be slaughtered by the millions? I think not. In a biblical society, this man would have been put to death, and rightly so.

"Today marks the one-week mark ahead of the first of the three presidential debates during the 2016 campaign and the candidates are gearing up. The Commission on Presidential Debates announced today the broad topics that are slated to be covered during the first debate: America's Direction, Achieving Prosperity and Securing America. The topics were selected by the moderator, Lester Holt of ""NBC Nightly News,"" but are ""subject to possible changes because of news developments."" The commission also made its final decision on Friday that there would only be two candidates taking the debate stage on Monday, Sept. 26. It ruled that neither Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson nor Green Party nominee Jill Stein had met the 15 percent mark in a combination of polls, which had previously been set as the bar for participation qualification.       Before Republican nominee Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Clinton head to Hofstra University, the site of the first debate, the candidates and their campaign aides have started teasing their debate prep strategies. Trump started his debate prep in late August, and at the time, sources told ABC News that he hadn't participated in mock debates, which is one of the more typical prep strategies for presidential candidates. As for Trump's personal debate strategy, he hasn't talked about the specifics of his game plan, focusing more on how he will deal with facing one opponent head on. ""I will treat her with great respect unless she treats me in a certain manner, in which case that will be the end of that,"" Trump said about Clinton last week during an appearance on Sean Hannity's Fox News show. ""But I'm certainly starting off with the feeling that I'm going to treat her with great respect. I hope we can talk about policy and certain things. I am not looking to go in and treat her with disrespect."" Clinton's press secretary Brian Fallon told MSNBC last Thursday that she won't ""go in there seeking to provoke Donald Trump."" ""She's going to do what she always does which shows she got the grasp of the issue and the command and poise of being commandeering chief. That contrast there will speak for itself,"" Fallon said.",true

"Hillary Clinton on Monday leveled some of her most charged attacks against Donald Trump yet, accusing the nominee of enabling Islamic State fighters with his rhetoric and hinting he may be committing treason. With a spate of domestic attacks over the weekend refreshing terror fears, Clinton and Trump hurled insults at each other on Monday, trying to convince voters that the other candidate would be a disastrous commander in chief. Story Continued Below Clinton held an impromptu news conference in the morning in which she presented herself as a steady hand in the face of terror threats and Trump as a reckless leader who is already making the United States less safe. “We’ve heard that from former CIA Director Michael Hayden, who made it a very clear point when he said Donald Trump is being used as a recruiting sergeant in and for the terrorists,” Clinton said. “We know from the former head of the Counterterrorism Center, Mike Olsen, that the language that Mr. Trump has used is giving aid and comfort to our adversaries,” she added, using the constitutional definition of treason. Trump’s camp fired back, blaming Clinton for the rise of the Islamic State because she supported pulling back on troops in Iraq in 2011. “Hillary Clinton’s comments today accusing Mr. Trump of treason are not only beyond the pale, it’s also an attempt to distract from her horrible record on ISIS,” Trump’s senior communications adviser Jason Miller said. Trump himself piled on, trying to shame Clinton and tying her to President Barack Obama on the terrorism issue. “Today, Hillary Clinton showed again that she will say anything — and blame anyone — to shift attention away from the weakness she showed as Secretary of State,” Trump said in a statement. “The Obama-Clinton doctrine of not taking ISIS seriously enough has emboldened terrorists all over the world. They are hoping and praying that Hillary Clinton becomes President so that they can continue their savagery and murder.” And during an afternoon rally in Florida, Trump accused Clinton of being tougher on his supporters than she has been on terrorists. “Hillary talks tougher about my supporters than she does Islamic terrorists, right?” he said, to cheers. “She called patriotic Americans who support our campaign, many of them cops and soldiers, deplorable and irredeemable, and she means it. Millions and millions of people,” Trump added, recalling remarks Clinton made earlier this month when she lumped half of his supporters into a “basket of deplorables.” The heated language on both sides comes as each are trying to reassure rattled Americans that they are the most capable of stepping into the commander in chief role. The series of planted bombs around New York and New Jersey over the weekend as well as the mass stabbing at a Minnesota mall has freshly raised fears of the reach of the Islamic State, even though details are still emerging about the inspiration for the attacks. While Clinton tried to present herself as the clearheaded alternative to Trump’s reckless bombast, she also had to thread the needle when it comes to her own legacy as secretary of state and Obama’s track record. “This is a serious challenge,” Clinton told reporters, as she sought to reassure voters that the U.S. is on the right track in combating that challenge. “We are well-equipped to meet it. And we can do so in keeping with smart law enforcement, good intelligence and in concert with our values.” She warned against getting “diverted and distracted” by Trump's inflammatory words, and dismissed Trump’s attacks on her past efforts to combat terrorism while at the State Department. “Well, it’s like so much else he says: It’s not grounded in fact. It’s meant to, you know, make some kind of demagogic point,” Clinton said. “I am prepared to, ready to actually take on those challenges, not engage in a lot of, you know, irresponsible, reckless rhetoric, but to do the hard work as I’ve done before, to put into place the strategies for local and state law enforcement for an intelligence surge, for the kind of preventive actions we need to take here at home and to intensify our efforts to defeat ISIS.” Clinton also suggested Americans won’t hear her opponent’s plan, and not because it's secret. “He keeps saying he has a secret plan. Well, the secret is he has no plan,” she said. “So let’s focus on what we really can do, and what I've laid out is a path forward that will keep us safer, protect our country and go after the terrorists to finally destroy them.” But Trump was eager to tether Clinton to Obama, and also pounced on a remark from White House press secretary Josh Earnest, who referred to the terrorism fight as a “narrative battle” against whether the U.S. and the West is battling against the Muslim religion. “I will bring an end to these senseless acts of violence. They are wrong to say that we’re in a fight about ‘narratives.’ These terrorists pose an existential threat to our country, our values, and our way of life,” Trump said. Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, joined in the sniping, saying he was dumbfounded by the White House’s use of the term “narrative fight” and linking Clinton to it. “I’m not sure that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama know that we’re at war,” Pence told conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. “The White House spokesman today actually said that we were in a — quote — narrative fight, in a narrative battle. I don’t even know what that is.” Obama, meanwhile, pats himself on the back as he credited the U.S. for exposing the Islamic State “as the failed cause that it is” by taking more of its territory.",true

"On January 20, 1961, newly elected and duly sworn into office President John F. Kennedy, a Democrat, ended his memorable and stirring inaugural address with the words “asking for God’s help, here on Earth, God’s work, must truly be our own.” Despite his obvious moral failings in his private life, President Kennedy’s personal ambitions were transcended by his belief that his primary duty in public life was to love his country and to serve her people. That said, we also know he was a Democrat, and the last Democrat to serve as President, whose efforts as Chief Executive were meant to build up America, rather than to tear America apart. Following the tragic assassination of President Kennedy on November 22, 1963, up to and including the present, there have been four more Presidents from the Democratic Party: Lyndon Johnson, (1963-69); Jimmie Carter (1977-81); Bill Clinton (1993-2001); and Barack Obama, (2009-?). Under their individual and collective brand of so-called leadership, the United States of America and her people have been steadily and systematically dismantled, fragmented, weakened, and mercilessly abused. During these past 50 years, thanks to the national Democrats and the left-wing allies in Congress, the White House and our Federal Court System, the national Democratic Party has become America’s largest and most powerful “hate group.” Lyndon Johnson, also known as “LBJ” took America into the malicious morass of the Vietnam war, and into the abyss of the equally malicious lie known as the “Great Society,” spending hundreds of billions of dollars on a vast system of socialist welfare spending that perpetuated poverty, especially in our cities and our minority communities, in a deliberate move to weaken the poor and less advantaged into federal dependency. At the same time, we fought an undeclared war in Vietnam and Southeast Asia for a decade, resulting in more than 58,000 needless deaths in the U.S. Military, only to lose the war and witness the humiliation of reunification of North and South Vietnam into one Communist nation. LBJ partnered with another, degenerate member of the Kennedy clan, Ted Kennedy, to engineer passage in 1965 of new immigration laws that started the stampede of mass legal and illegal immigration that eventually evolved into the “open borders” mess that brings in terrorists, America-haters and uneducated millions who promptly entered the social welfare system immediately upon arrival. James Earl “Jimmie” Carter, sat fecklessly in a cardigan sweater by the fireplace one January evening and told Americans that we were in a “malaise,” or more directly expressed, Americans were in a foul mood, anxious and frustrated by both an economy in shambles with high unemployment and high inflation, as well as a foreign policy that created the conditions to begin the awakening of long simmering but dormant radical Islam, with the takeover of the American Embassy and the “triumphant” return from French exile of the Ayatollah Khomeini to Iran and leadership in 1979. Carter sat in a cardigan sweater and blamed Americans for a mood of “malaise” that Carter created. Jimmie Carter’s primary accomplishment in four years as President was the humiliation of America before the rest of the world, as well as his own place in history as having been humiliated personally in the eyes of the majority of Americans. William Jefferson “Bill” Clinton began his Presidency on January 20, 1993 with his “gratuitous” attendance at the “Gay and Lesbian Inaugural Ball” in Washington, beginning on day one of his Presidency to repay the support in his election campaign of the LBGT Lobby. Soon after, Clinton announced the rueful break with two centuries of military tradition and law by instituting the infamous “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy permitting Gays to serve without fear of discharge. He put “Hillary the Horrible” Clinton in charge of an ill-fated attempt to ram socialized medicine down the throats of the American people, and Bill Clinton, with the successful enactment of the North American Free Trade Agreement or “NAFTA”, accelerated to “warp speed” the exodus of American businesses, jobs, and wealth to foreign nations such as Mexico, that had begun in the 1970s. Later in his Presidency his womanizing caught up with him and, after having one or more sexual affairs in the White House, was impeached by Congress, not for womanizing but for proceeding to lie to Congress and lie to the entire nation by denying the sexual immoralities. Three previous Democratic Presidents had succeeded in seriously damaging and weakening America, by the time the notorious Barack Hussein Obama was elected and sworn in as the 44th President on January 20, 2009. His eight years in office have included the most reckless borrowing and spending of any administration in history. Half our entire national debt ($10 Billion of the $20 Billion) was created in just the past eight years of Obama’s tenure. Yet Mr. Obama has absolutely nothing to show for all that reckless spending. The economy is in shambles, the infrastructure of highways, bridges, and public lands is crumbling, while the military forces and weaponry that must defend our nation is being systematically dismantled. Meanwhile tens of millions of Americans have been added to the already overwhelming financial burden in government through swollen welfare rolls, food stamps, forced early retirements, long term unemployment, and social security disability fraud. Mr. Obama, whose sworn duty along with Congress under the Constitution is to “promote the General Welfare, has instead promote the welfare of every small minority and special interest groups imaginable, in response to their collective loud potty mouths, collective asinine demands, and their collective calls for elevation to privileged and special legal status of their immoral and degenerate agendas. Mr. Obama has used the “bully pulpit” leadership tradition begun by Teddy Roosevelt, not to uplift, inspire and unify, but instead to berate, lecture and divide Americans. To Barack Obama, “(radical) black lives matter”; “gay and lesbian lives matter”; “radical Muslim lives matter”; “illegal alien lives matter”; convicted criminals lives matter”; meanwhile, the lives of ordinary, law-abiding, responsible working Americans, do not matter; the lives of Christians, foreign and domestic, do not matter; the lives of American military servicemen and women do not matter; the lives of our veterans do not matter; the lives of the “thin blue line” of peace officers in our police and sheriff departments do not matter; and, with all certainty, the protections due to Americans under our Constitution and the Bill of Rights, in the mind of Mr. Obama, do not matter at all. In the half century since the assassination of John F. Kennedy, under the Presidency of the four Democratic Presidents that followed, as well as the years of Democratic control of Congress, and Federal Courts, the national Democratic Party has deliberately and with malice aforethought trampled on the general welfare of the decent, hardworking and law abiding majority in America, while trampling on our rights and wastefully expending our tax dollars, to pay false homage to dozens of undeserving but vocal and demanding minority special interest groups, to the severe detriment of the much earned and deserving general welfare of the vast majority of our nation’s citizens. The national Democratic Party has become nothing short of America’s most powerful “hate group.” The American left wing, socialists and Democrats are the party that despises, attacks and works diligently and unceasingly to destroy all that is good within America. This “hate group” called the national Democratic Party demonizes: (1) law abiding morally upright American citizens; (2) unborn children; Christians; (3) Constitutional Conservatives; (4) legal gun owners; (5) job-producing energy businesses in oil, gas and coal production; (6) rural and small town America; (7) the ranching and farming West, including the “horse culture “ of wild mustangs and ranchers; (8) small business owners; (9) our police and our military, including veterans; and (10) above all, the Democratic party despises God, the Bible, Christianity and the ethical moral codes and common law inherent to Judeo-Christian foundations cited by the Founding Fathers 240 years ago. Although the Judeo-Christian, moral and ethical, Constitutional Conservative American majority is clearly despised by the “hate group” called the Democratic Party, we the American majority do not hate, because Jesus Christ taught us that the greatest commandment of all is to love one another, and not to hate the sinner, but to instead only hate the sin. The vast majority of Americans should, and indeed do, hate sin. However, the Democratic Party clearly despises us. To paraphrase John F. Kennedy’s words from 1961; Americans who are Constitutional Conservatives, Christians and law abiding, ethical citizens must “help every friend, and oppose any foe.” We must love and support each other, but at the same time, we must band together and fight the Left Wing. We must fight the evil of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. We must fight the immorality of communism, fascism, radical LBGT groups, radical Islam, collectivist Socialism, radical Atheism, and every foe of our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and Ronald Reagan’s “Shining City on the Hill.” A famous aphorism states, “All that is required for evil to prevail is for good men and women to do nothing.” Above all, therefore, righteous, conservative and patriotic Americans must fight evil, so that the good may once again prevail in America in the historically prevailing form of “Liberty, Justice and Virtue.”  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.",fake
"(CNN)Sen. Mark Kirk's campaign falsely asserted on its website that the Illinois Republican was a veteran of the Iraq war, a misstatement that comes six years after exaggerations over his military record nearly cost him his state's Senate seat. The Republican, now battling for a second term in a tight race in Illinois, stayed in the United States during the Iraq War when he served in the Navy Reserves. But on a public webpage on his official campaign website touting his record on veterans' issues, Kirk was listed as a ""veteran of the Iraq war."" While Kirk campaign officials said it was a staff error, the issue resembles the controversy that nearly caused his 2010 Senate campaign to implode. Moreover, Kirk is now running for reelection against Democratic Rep. Tammy Duckworth, a military veteran who lost both of her legs during combat in Iraq. Kirk campaign officials said the webpage was not meant to be made public, saying that it was supposed to be a private site while edits were being made to the page. Campaign officials said a third-party vendor had drafted the language that they said had not been vetted or reviewed by the senator's staff. The language, they acknowledged, was inaccurate, saying it would be changed when the campaign began a more direct push to court military veterans. After CNN inquired about the statement, the campaign moved the webpage behind a password-protected firewall. It had been accessible publicly and through Google searches about Kirk's work on veterans issues prior to that. Kirk campaign manager Kevin Artl downplayed the error -- and instead attacked Duckworth over her tenure leading the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs. ""Rather than focus on draft web copy that has yet to go through an approval process, we would welcome the media's attention on the six military veterans who died waiting for care during Tammy Duckworth's time at the Illinois Department of Veterans Affairs,"" Artl said. Duckworth campaign officials declined to comment. In 2010, Kirk came under heavy criticism for making a number of inaccurate comments about his military record, including falsely asserting he was the lone member of Congress to serve in Iraq and had been named the Navy's intelligence officer of the year. He later backtracked, including by saying he served ""during"" the Iraq war -- not ""in"" the war. He also later acknowledged that a different award was given by the Navy, and it was awarded to his entire unit. Kirk apologized for his misstatements, including one saying he had been fired on in 2000 while flying reconnaissance missions over Iraq and another saying he was a veteran of Operation Desert Storm in the early 1990s. During the Iraq war invasion of 2003, Kirk was a congressman representing a district encompassing suburbs north of Chicago. He served in the Naval Reserves at that time but was working stateside, even joking to a reporter in 2003 that he wouldn't see combat unless the Iraqi army came to Washington. After a 23-year career in the Navy Reserves where he served as an intelligence officer, Kirk retired from the service in 2013 -- a year after he suffered a major stroke that still affects his mobility and speech today.

"Were you worried that Donald Trump might fall victim to a âconcentrated Satanic attack?â Yeah? Well, you arenât alone. But good news folks, you donât have to worry about that anymore! God himself is now protecting the GOP nominee from the Dark Lord. On Wednesday, Trump attended the Midwest Vision and Values Pastors Leadership conferenceÂ in Cleveland.Â Trump-loving black man who lost his damn mindÂ pastor Darrell Scott was worried that Satan might be after Trump too, which is ironic since most of us assumed the Republican nominee was workingÂ  the Prince of Darkness already. Scott claims thatÂ before Trump began is bid for the presidency, aÂ ânationally knownâ preacherÂ warned him âthat if you choose to run for president, thereâs going to be a concentrated Satanic attack against you.â âHe said thereâs going to be a demon, principalities and powers, that are going to war against you on a level that youâve never seen before and Iâm watching it every day,â Scott said. Scottâs wife, Belinda Scott, prayed over Trump as those around him laid hands on the bigoted billionaire, making sure Satan knew they were serious, dammit: âGod we ask you right now that Your choice is this choice.â âGod, I ask that you would touch this man, Donald J. Trump,â she continued, âgive him the anointing to lead this nation.â Because what would Jesus do? Well, duh! Heâd make America great again. And naturally, he would use a racist demagogue to do it. (*Insert eye roll here.) Personally, I think they are a little late. At this point, they probably should have moved straight to an exorcism before his head starts spinning around.

"Hillary Clinton is a copycat who’s probably sleeping because she needs to rest, Donald Trump suggested Tuesday. In a pair of tweets bookended by a post announcing “two big rallies” in North Carolina, Trump accused the Democratic presidential nominee of “copying my airplane” and continued his assault over her stamina, or alleged lack thereof. Story Continued Below “Do people notice Hillary is copying my airplane rallies — she puts the plane behind her like I have been doing from the beginning,” Trump mused in a tweet Tuesday morning. “Hillary Clinton is taking the day off again, she needs the rest,” he added minutes later. “Sleep well Hillary — see you at the debate!” Trump’s critical comments come shortly after Clinton warned voters during a radio interview with Steve Harvey, “The next 50 days will determine the next 50 years.” Clinton also previewed what she expects from Trump in Monday's presidential debate in New York, telling Harvey she will do her “very best to communicate as clearly and fearlessly as I can in the face of the insults and the attacks and the bullying and bigotry that we’ve seen coming from my opponent.” “You know, I can take it, Steve. I can take that kind of stuff,” she added. “I’ve been at this and, you know, I understand it’s a contact sport.” Trump also attacked Clinton earlier Tuesday, questioning her effectiveness against the Islamic State as head of the State Department. “Crooked Hillary has been fighting ISIS, or whatever she has been doing, for years,” he said. “Now she has new ideas. It is time for change.” Clinton has no public events planned for Tuesday and has opted to stay at home in Chappaqua, New York, as she prepares for the debate with Trump. She had a full campaign schedule on Monday — between holding a news conference in White Plains, New York, a campaign speech and a fundraiser in Philadelphia, and three meetings with foreign leaders in New York City. She is scheduled to return to Florida for a campaign rally and fundraiser on Wednesday. Gabriel Debenedetti contributed to this report.",true

"Even as Donald Trump and his allies ramped up their fundraising and political infrastructure in August, their combined monthly fundraising haul lagged $42 million behind that of Hillary Clinton’s forces, according to a POLITICO analysis of reports filed Tuesday with the Federal Election Commission. The Trump campaign, two supportive super PACs and the Republican National Committee pulled in a combined $70 million, relying largely on small donors, during the tumultuous month of August, when his campaign shook up its leadership in an attempt to reboot after a chaotic nominating convention in July. Story Continued Below By contrast, the Clinton campaign, an allied super PAC and the Democratic National Committee, leaning heavily on major donors, raised a total of $112 million in August, as her campaign rode a strong bounce from its tightly choreographed, star-studded convention. Trump’s forces entered September with almost $96 million in the bank, while Clinton’s started the month with $121.4 million, according to Politico’s analysis. The analysis does not include fundraising tallies for the joint fundraising committees the rival candidates created with their respective parties, nor does it include the fundraising hauls from some supportive super PACs. All of those committees disclose their finances on a quarterly basis, meaning they won’t be required to file detailed financial reports until Oct. 15. But the analysis provides revealing hints about the contrasting strategies employed by the presidential candidates and their allies. The joint fundraising committee that Trump created with the RNC appears to be sitting on a significant sum of cash — perhaps as much as $47 million at the end of last month — while distributing only $12 million to the RNC itself and $20 million to Trump’s campaign. That transfer to Trump accounted for nearly half his August total — the first time he’s received such a large portion of his cash that way. Clinton, on the other hand, received $31.4 million from her own joint fundraising vehicle, and the Democratic National Committee received $12 million. An additional $12 million appear to have gone to state parties but been rerouted to the DNC, repeating a pattern from previous months. (The DNC also transferred out some $14 million to various state parties in August.) Trump’s campaign, which had largely eschewed spending on the trappings of political tactics, showed early signs of implementing a more conventional operation under its new leadership. It spent serious money — $5.3 million — on paid media in August, most of which went through Rick Reed Media, though $718,000 went through Jamestown Associates, the firm of his then-new senior communications adviser Jason Miller. That was dwarfed by the $32.7 million that Clinton paid her media buyer, GMMB, in August. Trump spent almost $1 million on field consultants, up from $432,000 in July. And his campaign’s staff grew to 140 people, with a total payroll of $643,000, up from $392,000 for 84 people in July. But that still trailed Clinton’s 789-person, $3.3 million payroll. Trump more than doubled his spending on field consulting in August to $973,000. The campaign also paid for polling, something it had been reluctant to do, directing $128,500 to the firm of Kellyanne Conway, who took over as campaign manager late in the month. And it spent $250,000 on data services provided by Cambridge Analytica, a firm owned largely by the influential Mercer family, which played a pivotal role in Trump’s campaign shakeup and is spearheading one of the super PACs backing the campaign. Still, the campaign continued devoting serious cash to bankroll the former reality TV star’s traveling show: $2 million went for rally-related expenses including facility rentals, audio-visual services, and event staging and consulting. Then, of course, there was the spending on Trump branding, which included $420,00 on hats and $1.7 million on T-shirts and other merchandise. And the campaign spent $547,000 on services provided by Trump’s own companies, including $170,000 for rent at Trump Tower and $319,000 on TAG Air Inc. By contrast, Trump spent only $80,000 on strategy consulting, with the firm of fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski receiving $20,000 of that. And the campaign’s largest expense continued to be online advertising and fundraising payments to the Austin-based digital firm of Trump’s digital director Brad Parscale, who is running the campaign’s online fundraising and advertising efforts, despite having no prior political experience. His firm reaped $11.1 million in August — up nearly $3 million from July and good for a third of all the campaign’s spending. Although the online fundraising effort overseen by Parscale helped produce an impressive small-dollar haul in which 65 percent of the campaign’s contributions came in amounts of less than $200, the payments to Giles-Parscale suggest the campaign has spent heavily on list rentals, email solicitations and online advertising to round up those small contributions. The percentage of cash that Clinton raised from small donors was half of Trump’s. About 31 percent of her cash came in checks of less than $200, which actually marked a slight improvement over her average across the cycle. Clinton and running mate Tim Kaine focused in August on big-dollar fundraisers in exclusive summer destinations. Likewise, the main super PAC supporting Clinton, Priorities USA, drew more than half of its $23.4 million August haul from its top five donors: Slim-Fast founder Daniel Abraham and Newsweb chairman Fred Eychaner ($3 million each), billionaire financier George Soros ($2.5 million), investor Donald Sussman and Laurene Powell Jobs’ Emerson Collective (both with $2 million). Trump received some good news this week about the fundraising of his own high-dollar super PACs. Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who had been sitting out the cycle so far, and his wife, Miriam, reportedly committed $5 million to a pro-Trump super PAC effort, but the group to which he has pledged the cash hasn’t launched the effort and it won’t disclose its finances until next month. The other super PACs supporting Trump have continued to lag in fundraising. Make America Number 1, the pro-Trump super PAC run by the Mercer family, received $1 million from Cherna Moskowitz, a Miami philanthropist, and $50,000 from Erik Prince, who founded the defense contractor Blackwater. But it didn’t receive any other big checks and didn’t get a dime in August from the Mercer family, which had donated $2 million to the PAC in July. Another pro-Trump super PAC, Great America PAC, appears to have the campaign’s blessing after Eric Trump, the candidate’s son, attended one of its events. But it raised only $3.6 million in August, including $250,000 from RHS Investments, a Texas company that appears to be tied to banking executive Robert H. Seale, and $200,000 from Martin Harmon of Rocklin, Calif. The Committee to Restore America’s Greatness and Rebuilding America Now — other pro-Trump super PACs — won’t disclose their financials until next month because they report on a quarterly cycle. The same goes for pro-Clinton groups American Bridge and Correct the Record.",true
"House Speaker Paul Ryan is facing a major obstacle in his months-long quest to pass criminal justice reform: unenthused House Republicans still skittish about looking soft on crime. The Wisconsin Republican for weeks has repeated his personal desire to move a bipartisan package that would include allowing well-behaved nonviolent prisoners to be eligible for early release and easing some drug-related sentencing requirements. Story Continued Below It would mark a major accomplishment for the speaker, and a chance for Republicans to show racial minorities they care about issues of social justice — plus a salient, positive message countering Donald Trump’s racially charged bid for the White House. But the odds are decidedly long. With Trump advocating for controversial policies like systematic “stop and frisk,” and the protests in Charlotte, North Carolina, against police-involved shootings causing racial tensions to flare, Ryan’s conference is not eager to vote on the matter. An internal GOP leadership “survey” last week taking House Republicans’ temperature on the issue showed that most members were lukewarm at best. That means that if Ryan wants to make a push for criminal justice reform after the election, he will have his work cut out. “It’s not an easy thing to make these reforms, and the [Judiciary] committee has taken some time doing it; now they’re taking time educating members on it,” Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) said Monday of a package of bills drafted by the Judiciary Committee. “It is a priority for the speaker. There are concerns … so we’re getting all the questions answered.” The Judiciary panel last year passed 11 bills to reform federal sentencing laws and improve the prison re-entry system. While the package would not eliminate mandatory minimum sentences, it would significantly reduce sentences for nonviolent drug offenders. It would also create a program to reduce recidivism rates. The politics of criminal justice reform have soured for conservative supporters. Trump has warned repeatedly of dangerous, crime-ridden cities. And the FBI on Monday released new statistics showing that murders increased 11 percent and violent crimes rose 4 percent in the U.S. last year. Though the rates are still low by recent historical standards, it's enough to make law-and-order Republican lawmakers nervous. While proponents argue that reform would go a long way toward easing racial tensions, opponents vow they’ll never vote against the recommendations of law enforcement during a time of unrest. (Some Republican lawmakers worry that law enforcement could come out against the pitch, though many national police groups haven’t taken a position.) Even if Ryan managed to get a bill through the House, the Senate and its 60-vote threshold could stop it in its tracks. Hawkish Republicans, including Sens. Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Jeff Sessions of Alabama, have been sounding the alarm against criminal justice reform. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has shied from the matter because it divides his conference. Democrats by and large support the reform proposals. Sources familiar with Ryan’s thinking say he’s not ready to relent just yet because of the charged political environment. While he wasn’t able to pass the Judiciary package in September as he originally hoped, Ryan is now eyeing the lame-duck session, by which time tensions might have eased. “I’m trying to get criminal justice reform done this session of Congress,” Ryan said last week during a speech at the Economic Club of New York. “That train is on the tracks, and I’m hoping we can get that done sooner rather than later.” The speaker has made second chances and redemption a central theme of his “Better Way” policy agenda, and he views criminal justice reform as key to helping people trying to turn their lives around. During the New York speech, he talked about visiting impoverished communities and being inspired by a onetime drug dealer who became a counselor to addicts, and a gang leader who went on to become an entrepreneur. “I went in expecting to see the worst of America and I came out realizing I had just seen the best of America,” he said. Ryan will have the backing of some big-name conservative allies. The Koch brothers and the conservative group Americans for Tax Reform are major advocates of criminal justice reform. But the skepticism or resistance among Republicans is real. “It doesn’t sell back home right now,” said Rep. Bill Flores of Texas, chairman of the Republican Study Committee. “When you say, ‘Hey, I’m voting for criminal justice reform,’ they’ll say, ‘What? You’re letting prisoners out of prison early?’” While he personally believes the Justice Committee has crafted some smart proposals, Flores said it doesn’t help that it’s a key priority of President Barack Obama. The situation in Charlotte and elsewhere has also complicated the equation. “I think that what could be a good bill could be perceived differently because of current events,” he said. Rep. Peter King of New York said he’s struggling to make up his mind on the pending reform measures. “I have friends on both sides of the issue, but I don’t know,” he said. “You’re talking about undoing 20 to 30 years of legislation. What are the unintended consequences?” Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, who leads the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said criminal justice reform “has real merit” but that there are “also some concerns.” “If you’re actually going to let people out of prison early, we better make sure they’re not violent people,” he said Sunday on C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers” show. “So let’s do it, but let’s do it right.” House leaders hosted a series of member and staff meetings during the August recess to familiarize Republicans with the Judiciary bills. GOP leadership sources say these sorts of sessions can move the needle, and they’re hoping that, over time, the conference will come around. Ryan, however, is racing against the clock. House Republicans will have to fund the government for all of 2017 during the lame-duck session, a contentious issue for the unruly GOP conference. It’s unclear whether Ryan will have the political capital and the bandwidth to do both.",true
"Donald Trump’s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, will continue to be paid severance by the campaign through the end of 2016, prolonging concerns of a conflict of interest for CNN, which controversially hired Lewandowski in June to serve as a political commentator. In addition, CNN shot down reports on Wednesday that Lewandowski was being suspended by the channel. “Corey Lewandowski, who is no longer involved in the campaign, continues to receive monthly severance payments,” Trump press secretary Hope Hicks told The Washington Post Wednesday. “The campaign will continue to honor its contract with Mr. Lewandowski, which stipulates he will be paid through the end of the year. These payments are in no way compensation for services rendered.” POLITICO reported on Tuesday evening that the Trump campaign had paid Lewandowski's firm $20,000 in August, according to campaign filings, for ""strategy consulting."" As The Washington Post pointed out, the description of the payment as ""strategy consulting"" appeared to contradict CNN’s claim that Lewandowski was being paid by the Trump campaign only for severance. Campaign employees being paid severance for so long after their departures is unusual, and it's not entirely clear why on the FEC forms the Trump campaign continues to call payments to Lewandowski as ""strategy consulting"" (we've reached out to the campaign for clarification and will update here accordingly). In an appearance on Fox News Radio, campaign manager Kellyanne Conway stressed that the payment is still part of his severance and pointed out that CNN also employs as commentators people who work for pro-Clinton Super PACs. ""He is not part of the campaign, he is a paid adviser on CNN and I think he's excellent in his job, frankly. Corey does not have a formal or informal role with the campaign whatsoever,"" Conway said. Mediaite on Wednesday reported that Lewandowski was being suspended by the channel following the new statement, but a spokesperson for the cable channel said the report was false, and that Lewandowski would be appearing on air later today. CNN President Jeff Zucker had for months defended the cable channel’s decision to hire Lewandowski. On Tuesday, the cable network head said at a company town hall for staff that the network ""needed to bring in voices supportive of the Republican nominee to balance its commentary ranks,"" The Huffington Post reported. Lewandowski has signed a non-disclosure agreement with the Trump campaign, and as part of that agreement agreed to a non-disparagement clause, according to the Associated Press which extends beyond his time working for the campaign. As POLITICO reported earlier this month, Lewandowski has been playing a wider role in the campaign recently, even if he technically is not an official part of it.",true
"Washington (CNN)Boxing promoter Don King thrust himself back into the political scene Wednesday when he dropped the N-word at a Donald Trump minority outreach event. It's the latest step into the political fray for King, who has a long history of colorfully weighing in on politics on both sides of the aisle going back half a century. After serving nearly four years in prison for a manslaughter conviction in 1966 for killing an associate who owed him $600, King was later pardoned of the crime in 1983 by then-Ohio Gov. Jim Rhodes. The governor received letters of recommendation from several luminaries, including former presidential candidate Jesse Jackson, a Democrat, and then-Cleveland mayor (and future Ohio senator) George Voinovich, a Republican. In 1992, King invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and refused to answer questions before a Senate subcommittee investigating ties between boxing and organized crime. Here are a few other political highlights from King's career: 'Republicrat' At the June funeral for Muhammad Ali, with whom King at one point worked, he declared his non-partisan status. ""I'm endorsing the people. I'm not a Republican or a Democrat, I'm a Republicrat, and I go with the will of the people,"" he told the New York Daily News. Hillary Clinton King previously praised Trump's Democratic presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, calling her ""dynamic"" at a 2014 fundraiser for Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, a major Trump critic. ""I have been a supporter of Secretary Clinton for a long time,"" King said at the event, which benefited the Nevada senator's re-election campaign. ""She is a dynamic woman, and I am a fighter for woman's rights,"" he added. Barack Obama The Cleveland native supported President Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012. At the time, he said white voters struggling to get behind a black candidate need to move past it. King said they should ""ask God to help you pretend that Barack Obama is white,"" he told journalists. ""I understand very well that after more than three centuries of being taught, conditioned and indoctrinated to hate the black man as your inferior, it is unrealistic to think that now you can just change to respect him,"" he wrote. ""Try to think of your beloved country America and what's best for Miss Liberty,"" King added. ""Then try not to think of Barack Obama as a black man but as an American fighting for what's best for your children and your country."" Reince Priebus King, The New York Times reported, was supposed to address this summer's Republican National Convention, but several Republican National Committee officials, including chairman Reince Priebus, nixed the idea, citing the promoter's legal problems. King later said the party chairman removed him because he doesn't ""like black people."" ""I'm not speaking because Reince Priebus is still thinking he don't like black people,"" King told reporters in July. ""I have less than a damn about what Reince Priebus thinks, especially when he's so antiquated."" Black Lives Matter King spoke on the tensions between black residents and law enforcement, saying the ""root"" of the problem gets lost in social media. ""You can't use short-term slogans because people don't understand and they twist them around,"" he said on the floor of the Republican National Convention. ""In our hashtag culture, we treat the effects, not the cause. You've got to get to the cause."" Female voters ""You got to understand what I'm trying to say to you is that the white woman -- and I put it in this kind of (words) so you understand what I'm saying -- the white woman and the slave, the people of color,"" King said Wednesday while campaigning for Trump. ""When the system was created, they did not get heard. The first will be last and the last will be first."" ""The white woman did not have the rights, and she still don't have the rights,"" he added. ""And people of color don't have their rights -- those are the 'left outs.'"" ""Donald Trump says no -- we (are) going back to inclusiveness,"" King added. ""Everybody counts."" On which political party is best for black voters ""Martin Luther King says that both the Republican and the Democrat have a long history of using the black vote as a political football: Promise us everything, give us nothing,"" he told New York Magazine in 2004. George W. Bush ""Oooh! I get a passion. I'm getting excited right now when you said that. George Walker Bush -- he's tough-minded but he's tender-hearted. He's trying to reclaim that glory of that American Dream for all Americans. He put African-Americans in top policy positions higher than any president. He took two people, black, and put them in charge of 300 million people for their security,"" he told New York Magazine. On Bush and terrorism ""George Bush utilizes the big stick. Whatever means necessary. If he wasn't in that White House when we had that despicable attack of terrorism in New York, I shudder to think, I tremble at what would be happening. We would probably have to be doing this interview on the underground, secretly, for fear if we'd go to the street, the treachery that abounds would take alight,"" he said in New York Magazine. ",true
"There’s a lot being said about football players across the NFL standing together in unity against police brutality. This is even more pertinent now, as even more black men have been gunned down in the street just this week by police. Using his press conference to bring further awareness to this topic was none other than Seattle Seahawks’ star cornerback Richard Sherman. He said: “I’m not going to answer any questions today, and it’s no offense to you guys, but the state of things in the world today is very interesting. I think you have players that are trying to take a stand and be aware of social issues and try to make a stand and increase people’s awareness and put a spotlight on it and they’re being ignored. Whether they’re taking a knee or whether they’re locking arms, you know, they’re trying to bring people together and united them for a cause. And I think that the last couple days a couple more guys have gotten shot and killed in the middle of the street and more videos have come out of guys getting killed, and I think people are still missing the point. The reason these guys are kneeling. The reason we’re locking arms is to bring people together. To make people aware that this is not right. You know, it’s not right for people to get killed in the street.” Sherman then explains how he’s been proactive in the community and even needing to go so far as to train young people of color on how to behave with the police, but still being fearful that they might get shot. He says, “that’s an unfortunate time to be living.” Especially when people are being killed for no reason. He then has some choice words by those who are supposedly offended by those standing up against police brutality by quietly using their First Amendment right of dissent and protest to bring awareness to the plight. Sherman says: “When a guy takes a knee, you can ignore it. You can say he’s not being patriotic. He’s not honoring the flag. I’m doing none of those things. I’m saying straight up, this is wrong and we need to do something.” And something most certainly needs to be done, and done now. Watch Sherman speak here: Wow— this is a must-watch.

"Washington (CNN)Rudy Giuliani blasted Hillary Clinton as ""too stupid to be president"" because she stayed with her husband after the Monica Lewinsky scandal. ""She didn't just stand by him -- she attacked Monica Lewinsky, and after being married to Bill Clinton for 20 years, if you didn't know the moment Monica Lewinsky said Bill Clinton violated her and was telling the truth -- then you're too stupid to be president,"" the former New York City mayor and prominent Donald Trump surrogate told Elite Daily shortly after Monday night's debate. Trump told CNN's Dana Bash shortly after the debate concluded that he was ""very happy that I was able to hold back on the -- you know, on the indiscretions with respect to Bill Clinton, because I have a lot of respect for Chelsea Clinton and I just didn't want to say what I was going to say."" Giuliani said the GOP nominee's biggest mistake during the debate was being ""too reserved and too gentlemanly."" Had he been debating, Giuliani said, he would have ""talked about what she did to Monica Lewinsky, what that woman standing there did to Monica Lewinsky."" The Lewinsky scandal resulted in Bill Clinton being impeached on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice, though he was ultimately acquitted in the Senate. When news of the scandal first broke in 1998, Clinton led the White House's behind-the-scenes damage-control efforts and appeared on several news programs to defend her husband, blaming the allegations on a ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" that she said was part of a political effort to bring down the president. Giuliani, however, accused Clinton of ""trying to paint her as an insane young woman."" He did not offer any proof in his interview and a message left with the Clinton campaign seeking response was not immediately returned. Giuliani and Trump have both been married three times and engaged in extramarital relationships that have led to past divorces. But asked about Trump's hint that he could bring up Bill Clinton's infidelity at an upcoming debate, Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day"" Tuesday that the former first lady was ""ready for anything."" ""This is -- it's such an obvious dodge. He spiraled out at the end of the debate and so, of course, he wants to bully. He wants to talk about the supposed indiscretions,"" Mook said.

"Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life’s purposes to serve and help his ‘brothers and sisters’ in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life. On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God. For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith…he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary. He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength. “In terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,” Wilson concluded. “I think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don’t stress out about much.” It’s a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to… themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing. Good men’s hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country. Especially now in Obama’s America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there…if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share… corruption can and will take root. So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith… Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don’t talk about God, it hurts people’s feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it’s heroes. With this kind of garbage happening…the truth becomes that much more obvious. Words like ‘tolerance’ are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep. Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad? There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening. …and Obama’s Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth. ",fake
"The top official in the country’s largest police union tweaked Donald Trump on Wednesday for leaping to blame the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The Fraternal Order of Police endorsed Trump last week, and that endorsement still stands, said Jim Pasco, the group’s executive director. But of Trump, said Pasco, ""he must be mindful of the due process rights and presumption of innocence accorded to all, including police officers.” Story Continued Below Trump has been reaching out to black voters in recent weeks, and on Wednesday, the Republican presidential nominee said he was “very, very troubled” by Tuesday’s shooting of Terence Crutcher by Officer Betty Shelby, and suggested her inexperience was to blame. ""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, okay? They can't be doing what they're doing,” Trump said at a church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. ""I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa. And that man was hands up,” Trump continued. “That man went to the car, hands up, put his hand on the car. I mean, to me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do, and he looked like a really good man."" The Fraternal Order of Police boasts 330,000 members, most of whom are rank-and-file cops, from all over the country. Last week, its national board voted to endorse Trump, based on members’ votes at the state chapter level. Trump’s law-and-order message and unequivocal support for police in other recent confrontations between cops and black men have made him popular with law enforcement, so his criticism of Shelby was an unusual departure. Clinton has sharply criticized the killings of both Crutcher and Keith Lamont Scott, whose death in Charlotte, N.C., prompted protests even as police said he was armed. Clinton said that such killings should “become intolerable” and touted the need for reform on Wednesday, and the day before she spoke about “implicit bias” in the context of the Tulsa incident. That prompted Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway to attack Clinton Wednesday morning, saying on Fox News, “It’s just unbelievable that she would do that before we even know the facts, the details. I think that’s an overpoliticization of a situation where we don’t know the facts.” Conway’s remarks came before Trump’s own suggestion that the officer choked.",true
"Donald Trump interrupted Hillary Clinton 25 times in the first 26 minutes. He claimed she lacked the “stamina” to serve as commander-in-chief. And when the question of his attitude towards women became an explicit topic of debate, he seemed to allude to resisting the urge to use her husband’s marital infidelity against her. Trump has been aggressive and crude with male debate opponents, too, and he addressed the former Cabinet secretary by her proper title throughout the sparring. But, going up against the first woman to take to a debate stage as a major party nominee in American history, did Trump come across as sexist? Story Continued Below According to Vox, he interrupted her nearly once a minute for the first 26 minutes of the debate. By 538’s count, Trump seized the floor from Clinton three times and lodged 24 interjections as she spoke, a total of 27 interruptions. Clinton didn’t seize the floor from Trump once, and lodged only 5 interjections. The pro-Clinton American Bridge counted a total of 73 interruptions by Trump. The appearance of chauvinistic bullying can be deadly for a male politician debating a female opponent. Just ask Rick Lazio, who sunk his 2000 Senate bid against Clinton when he left his podium mid-debate in an attempt to force her to sign a campaign finance pledge. Trump has thrived by indulging his natural inclination towards aggression, but has also been tripped up on his attitude towards women and issues that matter to them – like when Carly Fiorina confronted him for deriding the appearance of her face and when he was forced to walk back a statement that women should be punished for getting illegal abortions. And the risks for Trump are magnified. His opponents have consistently accused him of misogyny and his hopes in states like Ohio and Pennsylvania rest on suburban Republican women who are uneasy with the choice. After the debate, the Clinton campaign wasn’t touching the sexism question. “He has so much wrong with his performance tonight that something like that didn't even enter my mind,” said press secretary Brian Fallon. But others saw unmistakable chauvinism in Trump’s approach. “First of all the interruptions, he talked over her numerous times, the way he rolled his eyes…that to me was indicative of the gender issue,” said former North Carolina Sen. Kay Hagan, a Democrat. Trump himself seemed to sense a potential trap when moderator Lester Holt asked him to explain his prior comment that Clinton doesn’t have a presidential “look.” He quickly pivoted away from her physical appearance. “She doesn't have the look,” Trump responded. “She doesn't have the stamina. I said she doesn't have the stamina, and I don't believe she does have the stamina. To be president of this country, you need tremendous stamina.” Clinton shot back by citing her diplomatic forays to hundreds of countries and the 11 hours she spent before the House committee investigating the Benghazi killings. Then she knocked Trump for his treatment of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, saying, “He called this woman Ms. Piggy. Then he called her Ms. Housekeeping, because she was Latina. Donald, she has a name.” Trump responded by saying, “I was going to say something extremely rough to Hillary, to her family, and I said to myself, ‘I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice.’” After the debate, Trump confidant Rudy Giuliani said Trump was restraining himself from calling Clinton “phony as a feminist.” “This is the thing about Donald Trump is he has a big heart. He saw Chelsea in the audience, and he didn’t say what he was ready to say,” said Giuliani. According to the former New York mayor, Trump was preparing to say, “You take money from countries that stone women. You take money from countries that imprison women. You take money from countries where women can’t drive. You take money – not money, millions and hundreds of millions of dollars – from countries that treat women as cattle. You attack Monica Lewinsky, saying that she was basically insane, when it turned out your husband basically violated an intern in Oval Office of the White House, disgraced the United States of America, and you were one of the primary attackers, and after your years with Bill Clinton, if you don’t know that Monica Lewinsky was telling the truth then you’re not smart enough to be president.” Giuliani’s counterpunch aside, it was Trump who faced more post-debate scrutiny on gender issues. Republican women are crucial to Trump’s chances, and those watching the debate fell into two camps: Those who sensed sexism and those who felt gender dynamics were the least of Trump’s problems on Monday night. Liz Mair, a Republican strategist who opposed Trump in the primary, said he came across as “the kind of guy ever woman out there has rolled her eyes at and turned down flat at least a couples times in her life.” Katie Packer Gage, another Republican strategist who opposed Trump in the primary said that the unscripted environment brought out the impulses that caused Trump so much trouble before his recent streak of relative message discipline. “He has such a long record of demeaning and disparaging and bullying women that this is just a reminder of so many things that have been kind of forgotten in the last week because he’s sort of learned how to behave in proper company when he’s scripted,” she said. But other Republican women saw it as a red herring. “I thought it was many things but not sexist,” said conservative commentator Dana Loesch, a frequent Trump critic, of the businessman’s performance. “I think a discussion of stamina with respect to any sex is fair game when the context is commander-in-chief.” “For Trump standards, he was fairly subdued. At least he didn’t call her fat and ugly and tell her her voice game him a headache,” zinged Republican commentator Ana Navarro, who has sparred with Trump this campaign season. To Sarah Isgur Flores, Fiorina’s deputy campaign manager, Trump treated Clinton the way he’s treated his male opponents. “Hillary’s team would e making a mistake crying foul over Trump being Trump,” she said. “It can only take away from her performance at this point.” Clinton’s performance aside, her face remained an object of analysis. While Trump resisted the invitation to weigh in again on her physical appearance, Fox News’ Brit Hume filled that gap for him. “The Trump expression was one we’re all familiar with from the earlier debates – he looked annoyed, put out, uncomfortable,” Hume said after the debate. “And she looked, I think for the most part, she looked composed — smug sometimes — not necessarily attractive.” Gabriel Debenedetti contributed to this report.",true
"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s infamous line, “we have nothing to fear but fear itself,” the Pope chastised fear-based media. Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of “terrorism” and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of “terrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue”, he said. “This is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.” Source: Reuters Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy’s press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I’m sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that’s what has given us Donald Trump. Crime in the nation is down. An American’s odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans: Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic Sure, that’s about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn’t directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they’ve succeeded.

"President Obama today vetoed a bill that would allow survivors of the 9/11 attacks, along with victims' families, to sue the government of Saudi Arabia. “I am returning herewith without my approval S. 2040, the ‘Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act’ (JASTA), which would, among other things, remove sovereign immunity in U.S. courts from foreign governments that are not designated state sponsors of terrorism,” Obama notes in the veto message. “I have deep sympathy for the families of the victims of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 (9/11), who have suffered grievously. I also have a deep appreciation of these families' desire to pursue justice and am strongly committed to assisting them in their efforts.” The veto comes at the end of a 10-day constitutional window after Congress' overwhelming approval of the legislation, setting up a fight that's likely to hand the outgoing president his first veto override. Suffering his first veto override so late in his second term would be significant, especially considering the president's high approval ratings relative to the rest of his presidency. By comparison, former President George W. Bush was overridden twice during his two terms in office and only in his final two years when his approval rating had plummeted. The last president to make it through a full presidency without a veto override is Lyndon B. Johnson.       If passed into law, the legislation would allow victims of terrorism to sue foreign governments for damages. Obama and the White House have argued that language in the bill could potentially compromise the principle of “sovereign immunity,” and put the U.S. government and entities at risk of being sued by other countries. ""Overriding the president's veto means that this country will start pursuing a less forceful approach in dealing with state sponsors of terrorism and potentially opens up U.S. service members and diplomats and even companies to spurious lawsuits in kangaroo courts around the world,"" White House press secretary Josh Earnest explained to reporters today. ""Our concern extends not just to the impact this would have on our relationship with Saudi Arabia, but rather the impact that this could have on the United States' relationship with countries around the world."" But the showdown has also put the Obama administration at odds politically with the wishes of countless 9/11 families who argue they haven't had their day in court against all parties responsible for the terror attacks. Saudi Arabia has itself spoken critically of and personally lobbied against the effort, maintaining it had no role in assisting the 9/11 terrorists. The House and Senate each passed the measure by unanimous consent. A veto override requires a two-thirds vote by each chamber, and the White House says it has been working diligently behind the scenes to rally enough Democrats to block the override effort. Obama's former Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, has also indicated she would sign the legislation into law if she wins the presidential election.",true
"WashingtonSince we last updated the CNN battleground map, Donald Trump has clearly improved his poll numbers both in some national polls and in some critical battleground states. The Republican nominee has also upped his game (as have his allied outside group friends) with television ad spending.  And, yet, Hillary Clinton maintains her advantage on the Road to 270 when it comes to piecing together the electoral math needed to win the presidency. Why two congressional districts could be key to this election With four days to go before the highly anticipated first presidential debate and just under 7 weeks before all the votes are cast, Hillary Clinton still sits above that key threshold in the latest CNN outlook. When you add up all the states either solidly or currently leaning Clinton's way, she has 272 electoral votes in her column in our new estimate. What's changed? -- Iowa (6) moves from from ""battleground"" to ""lean Republican"" -- Utah (6) moves from ""lean Republican"" to ""solid Republican"" -- Maine's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground"" -- Nebraska's 2nd Congressional District (1) moves from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground"" Explore the map and make your choices Road to 270: Electoral College map Note: The split congressional district ratings are symbolized with diagonal lines. The state of play Donald Trump has improved his standing in our electoral college outlook due to Iowa (a state Barack Obama won twice) and its six electoral votes moving from the true toss-up ""battleground"" category into the ""lean Republican"" category, giving Trump a total of 196 electoral votes either solidly or leaning in his favor.  That leaves 70 electoral votes up for grabs across four states (plus two congressional districts) -- Florida, Nevada, Ohio, and North Carolina.  Maine and Nebraska award individual electoral votes by congressional district in addition to the multiple electoral votes based on statewide results. Both Maine and Nebraska's second congressional district have moved into battleground status in this latest estimate. Maine's second congressional district has moved from ""solid Democrat"" to ""battleground"" and Nebraska's second congressional district has moved from ""solid Republican"" to ""battleground,"" providing an opportunity for a candidate to pick up a single electoral vote in what otherwise might be hostile territory.  Finally, Utah moves back from ""leaning Republican"" to being solidly being in Trump's column.  There is no doubt that Trump has improved his chances in the last several weeks and that he is extremely competitive in all of the remaining critical battleground states, but Clinton's firewall is not yet showing any significant cracks and that is what makes Trump's path to 270 electoral votes still quite challenging. For all of the endless talk about Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, it is perhaps most important to keep your eye on Clinton's performance in the states that are leaning her way, but not solidly in her camp. Pennsylvania, Colorado, Michigan, and Virginia are the core of Clinton's current stronger and more viable path to 270. If Trump begins to find significant inroads to any of those blue-leaning states, that will set off some alarm bells at her Brooklyn HQ and suggest a more viable path for Trump. It is not enough for Trump to simply win the remaining 70 electoral votes in the battleground states -- that only gets him to 266. He still needs to chip away at Clinton's Democratic leaning firewall. Ohio poised to go down to the line on Election Day That's why we see both Trump and Clinton and their surrogates returning again and again to Pennsylvania, for example. And that's why Clinton and pro-Clinton forces spent more than $16 million on television ads in the Keystone State compared to the $5.3 million we've seen from Trump and pro-Trump forces. In fact, Pennsylvania is the state with the third-highest number of ad dollars spent this cycle, behind only Florida and Ohio. Clinton and Trump will surely continue the fully engaged battle for the votes of Floridians and Ohioans, but until and unless Trump can put one of those Democratic leaning states back on the board as a battleground or even make one lean his way, Clinton's electoral college advantage holds.

"From the “You Just Can’t Make This Up” Department comes this story about the latest words that anti-free speech progressive leftists want to eliminate from the lexicon because of some contrived grievance or offense. Now, believe it or not, the term “American BBQ” has been determined to somehow be offensive by a college full of numbskulls. The fine people over at Campus Reform, who are keeping track of this kind of idiocy, report: Students at Ramapo College were recently forced to change the theme of an “American BBQ” because the administration deemed it too “offensive.” According to emails obtained by Campus Reform, Ariana Rivera, the Assistant Residence Director of Bischoff Hall, sent an email to the College Republicans and the College Democrats on August 17 inviting the groups to co-sponsor an American-themed BBQ with Bischoff and Mackin Halls. What in the hell is offensive about “American BBQ?” Can you think of anything? Me neither. However, according to emails obtained by Campus Reform, the term was somehow determined to be “military and recruitment-oriented.” No kidding. Maybe it’s the term “American” that bothers these idiots. It’s getting pretty obvious that the Left wants all speech banned — all speech that they disagree with.

"The Donald Trump campaign has improved logistics for the traveling press following the candidate, putting the journalists in the motorcade and on a dedicated chase plane. Though reporters covering the Republican nominee will not necessarily travel at all times on the same plane as Trump, they will now be in a dedicated ""chase"" plane and will drive within the Trump motorcade. These moves will significantly improve travel for the media covering Trump, who last week were left behind when reporters got stuck in New York City traffic trying to get a different airport than the one Trump, whose motorcade cuts through traffic, was flying out of for an event in New Hampshire. Despite requests to wait for the traveling press, Trump started the event without his traveling press corps and mocked them for being late. Reporters will travel with Trump on his plane ""when logistically feasible,"" the campaign said, according to one member of Trump's traveling press corps. Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks, when asked whether the improved logistics were in reaction to last week's problems, said the move ""has been in the works for weeks."" Neither campaign has a full protective pool, meaning reporters cover the candidate as the president is covered by the White House press corps, from leaving their residence to return. Hillary Clinton's press corps have a quasi-protective pool, and have been traveling with her on her plane and within her motorcade since the Labor Day holiday. However, her press corps is not with her at all times as was evidenced earlier this month when Clinton fell ill and left a 9/11 memorial service early, leaving the press corps behind and without information for nearly two hours.",true
"Maureen Dowd has covered Donald Trump for more than a decade as a columnist for The New York Times.

And then his desk is all full of magazines where he is on the cover...the whole office is like this pure odyssey through his ego.” Speaking on ABC’s Powerhouse Politics Podcast, Dowd said she wondered why he would want to become a politician. “I asked him once, ‘Why are you running.’ It didn’t seem to me a wise decision to trade in a perfectly good reputation as this kind of fun huckster for a reputation as a scary Hitler. And I said, ‘Why couldn’t you run more like the person you were in New York all those years?'"" she recalled. ""He had a cartoonish reputation like a Batman character or villain but not hatred."" Dowd, author of the new book, ""The Year of Voting Dangerously, the Derangement of American Politics,"" said she was disappointed by Trump’s recent tweet calling her ""wacky"" and a ""neurotic dope."" ""I felt like he hadn’t put much effort into giving me a good nickname. He calls all women reporters that he doesn’t like 'wacky and neurotic,'"" she said. ""I was hoping I would have something more distinctive like Pocahontas or Sleepy Eyes, which he uses for Chuck Todd. But I just got a generic one for women.” ABC News' Jon Karl and Rick Klein asked Dowd whether her sister, who had been a Trump supporter, would be voting for him. ""I talked to Trump about this. He said, 'Is your sister still voting for me?' a couple months ago. And I said 'No' because you retweeted that unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz,"" Dowd said. ""And he said it was not that unflattering. And I said, 'Yes it was. It was just a terrible thing to do. Why don’t you just apologize?' And there was this long silence.

"Obama’s time as president is almost over and millions of Americans are counting down the days until he vacates the Oval Office. He promised before taking office that he would fundamentally change America and he did… for the worse. It’s hard to believe that his legacy will be remembered fondly once he’s left office, considering that virtually everything he has implemented has been a miserable failure. But that hasn’t stopped him from patting himself on the back anyway — and telling Americans that they need to protect his legacy once he’s left office. In a speech to the Congressional Black Caucus on Saturday night, Obama used Jim Crow laws and slavery in an effort to encourage people to vote for the “right” candidate. He told the people assembled that his legacy was at stake, so they needed to give him a good send off by registering people to vote. And those people, of course, need to vote for Hillary Clinton.   While Obama did not mention Hillary by name, he said it would be an insult to him if the black community does not support her. “My name may not be on the ballot, but our progress is on the ballot,” he said. “And there is one candidate who will advance those things. And there is another candidate who’s defining principal, the central theme of his candidacy is opposition to all that we have done.” He then cited the historic turnout among the African-American community in 2008 and 2012, saying, “I will consider it a personal insult, an insult to my legacy, if this community lets down it’s guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good send off? Go vote!”   Of course, history contradicts everything that Obama said. It was Democrats, not Republicans, that supported slavery, segregation and Jim Crow laws. The Republican Party was formed specifically to end slavery. The original Congressional Black Caucus were the first black members of Congress… and they were Republicans. Democrats came up with the Ku Klux Klan in order to prevent black Americans from voting. Meanwhile, Obama’s actual legacy with the black community isn’t exactly stellar. It was the Obama administration that cancelled D.C.’s school voucher program, so that low-income minority children could not go to expensive private schools, like the one Obama’s children got to attend. And under Obama’s leadership, unemployment and food stamp usage have skyrocketed, hitting the black community harder than any other. He’s done nothing about the destruction of the black family, the disproportionately high number of black babies aborted every year, or the fact that almost 76% of black children are born out of wedlock. And he wants to brag about his legacy? Is he out of his mind? ",fake
"Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly is teaming up with ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" producer Michael De Luca for a new scripted comedy series that will focus on the life of the campaign embeds on the presidential trail. The series, called ""Embeds"", will feature six half-hour episodes following ""five young reporters in way over their heads as they find themselves shaping the future of the country through raucous adventures in an unexpected world of sex, drugs, and swing states on the presidential campaign trail,"" Variety reports. The project is an amalgamation of new and old media from across the spectrum: SnapChat's Peter Hamby (a former CNN reporter) and Vice News' Scott Conroy co-created and will write the script for Verizon-owned streaming platform Go90. According to Variety, Conroy, who was just hired by Vice as a producer for politics and policy on Vice's new nightly show, will leave Vice News for the project. ""Embeds"" is not Kelly's first foray into the scripted television world. She is also developing and producing the White House drama “The Residence” for FX alongside actor Kevin Spacey.",true
"As most of our readers are well aware, there has been immense speculation recently regarding the health status of Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Following in the wake of Clinton’s near collapse at the 9/11 memorial service earlier this month, some have suggested that Clinton may be suffering from some sort of neurological disorder that is causing her to have dizzy spells and difficulty walking or standing, particularly when dealing with steps. There is sure to be renewed speculation in that regard following a bit of video that emerged Sunday via a Twitter post from Clinton pool reporter and ABC News journalist Liz Kreutz, who happened to catch Clinton as she was leaving a building in New York City, according to the Conservative Treehouse. Clinton was exiting the Appleseeds Kids Center and preparing to descend a set of stairs when Kreutz approached, camera rolling, and began to ask questions of the candidate.  Clinton just left ""Apple Seeds"" kids center in Flatiron. Feeling good about debate? ""Getting ready, getting ready!"" pic.twitter.com/mXxBbMiVcu — Liz Kreutz (@ABCLiz) September 25, 2016  As can be seen in the video, Clinton seemingly ignored the reporter’s first questions, instead remaining intently focused on grabbing the handrail and her footing on the steps as she descended. Once she was about three-quarters of the way down the stairs, only then did Clinton turn her attention to the reporter, flashing a sudden smile but continuing to ignore the questions, replying with only “Getting ready” when pressed about her preparedness for the first presidential debate Monday evening. She then carefully hoisted herself up into her special campaign van, without any assistance, though a Secret Service agent stood ready to perhaps lend a hand right behind her. While it is entirely plausible that Clinton didn’t see or hear the reporter until she had reached the bottom of the steps, this video clip will likely still serve as further proof that she is suffering from some sort of medical issues that make it difficult for her to walk up and down stairs. The video certainly reinforces the supposition that Clinton suffers from selective hearing, picking and choosing which questions she will acknowledge and answer while ignoring others that may prove difficult or too revealing for her. Please share this on Facebook and Twitter so that everyone can see Hillary Clinton seemingly struggle in her effort to successfully descend a flight of stairs, so much so that she virtually ignored a reporter standing and watching in close proximity. What do you think of the apparently extra-careful manner in which Hillary Clinton was spotted descending a small set of stairs? Scroll down to comment below!",fake
"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s campaign is in shambles and he is doing his best to soak the government for as much money as possible before he is humiliated at the ballot box by Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump’s latest escapade has been to swindle $1.6 million from the U.S. Secret Service for the honor and privilege of protecting him, according to FEC filings. The Secret Service has a policy of reimbursing the campaigns of presidential candidates for the costs incurred due to various agents traveling with the candidate. Typically a campaign will pay for the airfare of the Secret Service, and the campaign is then reimbursed those funds. However, Trump has found a way to make a profit through this policy by chartering planes to the Secret Service owned by, TAG Air, Inc, one of his companies. Therefore, the Secret Service – and the American taxpayer- are literally paying Trump. This is in sharp contrast to Hillary Clinton’s campaign which has been chartering planes through Executive Fliteways, to which Clinton has no financial dealings or hopes of personal reimbursement. One’s imagination does not require a stretch to see the outrage amongst fanatical Trump supporters if Clinton were profiting from her travel, but selective outrage is their stock and trade. Trump’s campaign says there is nothing illegal about what they’ve done. A spokeswoman of Trump’s campaign, Hope Hicks, said, “Everything was done in accordance with FEC guidelines and regulations. Please direct further questions to USSS.” Along with Secret Service payments, Trump may also be soaking news organizations for the costs of journalists traveling with his campaign for the same reasons. It is also possible the Secret Service has been forced to pay Trump when their agents sleep in his grotesque golden hotels, as Trump stays at his own properties whenever possible. This is likely because he enjoys sleeping on the cheapest Chinese made beds money can buy.",fake
"Washington (CNN)Members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee voted along party lines Thursday to hold the architect of Hillary Clinton's private email server in contempt for failing to appear before them. The panel's 19-15 vote came after Bryan Pagliano failed to attend a second hearing on Clinton's emails and use of a private server while leading the State Department. Republicans blasted his decision as an act of defiance, but Pagliano's lawyers said the demand that he appear ""betrays a naked political agenda."" House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Utah Republican, argued that previous testimony from another one of Clinton's IT workers, Justin Cooper, made it imperative for Pagliano to testify. ""I explained Mr. Pagliano was uniquely qualified to provide testimony to help the committee better understand Secretary Clinton's use of a private email server. This is indisputable,"" Chaffetz said. ""I also made clear the committee would consider all options regarding Mr. Pagliano's failure to appear, including consideration of recommending he be held in contempt."" RELATED: Road to 270: CNN's latest electoral college map Pagliano was first called before the oversight committee last week but did not appear. Pagliano pleaded the Fifth Amendment in a closed-door hearing last year of the House panel investigating the Benghazi attacks. It is unclear when the full House would take up a vote on the contempt resolution approved Thursday. Pagliano's lawyers accused Chaffetz of launching a witch hunt. ""A subpoena issued by a congressional committee is required by law to serve a valid legislative purpose -- and there is none here. Your demand under the present circumstances, that Mr. Pagliano again assert his constitutional rights in front of video cameras six weeks before the presidential election, betrays a naked political agenda and furthers no valid legislative aim,"" Pagliano's lawyers wrote in a letter to the committee on Wednesday. RELATED: How to watch the first presidential debate Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the panel, defended Pagliano's refusal to appear. ""There is no legitimate legislative purpose in forcing Mr. Pagliano to appear before the committee to assert his Fifth Amendment rights before Congress for a second time, and there is certainly no legitimate legislative purpose in forcing him to do so in public,"" Cummings said Thursday. The Clinton campaign said Thursday it had not told Pagliano whether or not to testify, and blasted the oversight hearings into her private email server. ""He made his own decision, but we certainly have not prevailed upon anyone to cooperate with this sham of an inquiry,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said. ""The career officials at the FBI and the Justice Department already thoroughly investigated this matter, and closed the case with no further action, and Jason Chaffetz is abusing his office with this blatantly partisan attempt to hurt Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign.""

"One woman was killed and several children were injured after airstrikes pounded the city of Aleppo, according to residents and activists. On Sunday, warplanes targeted the besieged Syrian city for the first time since the cease-fire went into effect last week, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The 52-year-old woman died after a wall fell on her after airstrikes on her house, according to Abu Rajab, a radiologist and managing director of the hospital where she was treated in Aleppo's al-Sakhur neighborhood. ""She had a head injury and suffered suffocation,"" Abu Rajab, told ABC News. Four children were also treated at the hospital, he said. Among them was a 15-year-old girl who had pieces of shrapnel in her chest. ""She was experiencing severe pain and is still under observation at the hospital,"" Abu Rajab said. Another child, a 3-year-old girl, was injured in the scalp and right hand. ""We give children gifts to help them relax. I gave her a toy train so that she could play with it and forget her pain,"" Abu Rajab said, adding that the girl remains in the hospital. Two other children, a 3-year-old and a 2-year-old, were treated at the hospital and have been discharged, according to Abu Rajab. ""They had lighter wounds and stayed for one day,"" he said. ""They had dust in their lungs and we gave them oxygen."" The U.S.-Russian-brokered cease-fire agreement was focused on reducing violence in the war-torn region and delivering humanitarian aid. The agreement had to be met before Russia and the U.S. would work together to fight militant groups ISIS and al-Nusra in Syria. So far no aid has entered eastern Aleppo, where up to 275,000 people live under siege, according to the United Nations. Two U.N. trucks carrying flour and food supplies that could feed around 185,000 people for one month are still parked by the Turkish border, ready to go. ""I am pained and disappointed that a United Nations convoy has yet to cross into Syria from Turkey, and safely reach eastern Aleppo, where up to 275,000 people remain trapped without food, water, proper shelter or medical care,"" Stephen O’Brien, U.N.'s undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, said in a statement today. ""All parties must facilitate regular and sustained access to families in all the besieged and hard-to-reach areas across the country, through both cross-line and cross-border routes. The people of Syria have suffered long enough. Millions of Syrian civilians continue to face horrific deprivation and violence, especially those trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas."" Aid workers have not been able to reach eastern Aleppo since clashes between the Syrian government and armed rebel groups started on July 7.

"Hillary Clinton’s recent reference to many of Donald Trump’s supporters as a “basket of deplorables” comprised of racists and homophobes only made explicit what her advertisements and other public statements have insinuated. Three weeks ago, she released a video that confronts Trump with the support he has received from white supremacists. In it, Jared Taylor, editor and founder of the white-supremacist magazine American Renaissance, is quoted from an interview with CNN: “Sending out all the illegals, building a wall, add a moratorium on Islamic immigration—that’s very appealing to a lot of ordinary white people.” Story Continued Below It’s pretty obvious what Clinton hopes to get from this line of campaigning: Underscoring Trump’s endorsements from white supremacists might deter moderates, independents and mainstream Republicans who are loath to be associated with the right-wing fringe. However, her mudslinging also condemns Trump voters—half of them, at least—who may support Trump’s social platform, but not in the interest of institutionalizing the supremacy of white people. These white working-class voters support Trump because he articulates their complicated discomfort with immigration and demographic change. Some observers are quick to call them racist—and certainly some are. But over the past six months, I’ve interviewed more than 100 white working-class people both here and in the United Kingdom, where a similar nationalist surge has triggered accusations of racism. My interviews suggest that there is a complexity to Trump’s supporters that is not as simplistic as a yes-no binary about whether they’re racist. Millions of Trump’s supporters exist in the vast space between Wall Street and Breitbart. Is it racist to associate immigration with the greater globalization of commerce that has altered the economic prospects of outmoded people? Is it racist to be frustrated that members of ethnic minorities are rendered new advantages unavailable to white people, such as affirmative action policies and ethnicity-specific advocacy? Is it racist to believe that white working-class people are underrepresented in political leadership or vilified in popular media? Clinton’s decision to lump all voters with these concerns into the sweeping category of “racist” might motivate her base, and might even be correct as a short-term political calculation: She probably won’t win over these voters. But there’s a long-term societal risk here: Shunning them as racists pushes them only deeper into pockets of private discomfort, where their perceptions go unexposed and unchallenged—entrenching their views and further polarizing the American public. Ultimately, Clinton’s statements will worsen a long-term social dilemma among the voters she broad-brushes—how Americans understand racism itself. *** “Racism” is a powerful word in American culture, and an important one to talk about. It’s the right way to describe the long history of prejudice and discrimination against people on the basis of their looks and ancestry. It’s also important to identify in modern society, linking contemporary expressions and ideas to earlier injustices, such as the enslavement of blacks or the genocide of native people. While they may not be equivalent, housing discrimination and police violence against African-Americans—enduring forms of racism—are thus rightly seen as legacies of past oppression. This is valuable because it contextualizes the choices and policies of contemporary Americans in our troubled history of race. However, allegations of racism are now viewed by many white people as a means of wielding their ancestors’ misdeeds to unfairly disqualify their dissenting viewpoints in the present. In the view of many of the voters Trump is speaking to—not just the “alt-right,” but disaffected white voters across the board—it’s crucial to talk frankly, even critically, about the perils of Islam, immigration and Black Lives Matter, even if it means offending some listeners. And on the more politically activated end of that spectrum, such voters see suppression of their ideas is part of a broader conspiracy to impose a liberal worldview. It’s a perception that has been seized by Trump—“We cannot afford to be so politically correct anymore,” he said in his July GOP convention speech—but also by far-right leaders in Europe, like Britain’s Nigel Farage, the former head of the UK Independence Party and one of the leaders behind the UK's departure from the European Union. Both Trump and Farage have heralded the power of their countries’ “silent majority”—a hushed constituency of predominantly white voters whose views have long been ignored. Many of these purportedly ignored views scapegoat minority groups for broader social problems—often based on stereotypes, myths and prejudice. But even well-meaning conservative critiques of social policies have been tarnished by far less valid accusations of racism. From the time I’ve spent interviewing white working-class people in the United States and the UK, I’ve seen how many people find Trump’s and Farage’s unfiltered statements refreshing. The two men elevate hearsay to podiums and shout the very ideas that supporters have been too intimidated to mutter under their breath. In Britain, dozens of my respondents would often preface their most candid thoughts to me by stating “I’m not a racist, but … ” “I’m not racist, but this country’s covered by blacks and Bosnians.” “I’m not racist at all. I’ve got black cousins and nieces. But the Polish have been taking all of the work and running prostitution and drug rings.” “I’m not a racist. I fucking love goat curry, pardon my language. But the principle of English families not coming first is just not right.” These individuals had not endured hours of sensitivity training; they were concerned that their ideas would be disqualified, when they are, in fact, sincere expressions about how their societies are being transformed. Racism is perceived to be a “mute button” pressed on someone while they are still crying out about a sense of lost status—from a position of historic advantage, frequently in terms they have difficulty articulating. Therefore, the preface “I’m not racist” is not a disclaimer, but rather an exhortation to listen and not dismiss or invalidate the claims of a group that feels marginalized. Interestingly, those respondents who were able to more specifically articulate their frustration framed it in the civil rights themes of equality and justice. An unemployed 18-year-old Londoner said, “You go for an interview and most of the employers are Asians. Basically, they’re discriminating against us, and we were here first. I have some training as a retail sales assistant. But when I’ve submitted my CV, I’ve been told that I can’t apply because I’m not Asian. … I feel like I’m beneath them.” Back in the United States, an electrician from Youngstown, Ohio, told me that “white people have become the minority itself. … People have freaked out on me for things I’ve said because I can’t say anything [about black people] because of slavery and their historical oppression. People aren’t looking for equality; they’re looking for retaliation.” These two were not members of any white-supremacist group. Many white working-class individuals simply view the broader struggle against racism as one that demotes white people, rather than promotes others to equal ground. They feel estranged from minority groups, who they believe have access to new privileges that compensate for historic advantages that today’s white working-class people do not recall exploiting. They feel alienated from an urban white bourgeoisie, which has divorced their less skilled or geographically isolated co-ethnics and look down upon them. And they feel blamed for neither empathizing with the plight of minorities, nor mobilizing to overcome structural poverty and embrace global cosmopolitanism. *** To govern effectively, Hillary Clinton needs white people to buy into the social change she heralds. So instead of casting them as outmoded bigots, she could point to how the very social forces that entrench white working-class people into poverty also entrench minority groups—that there are no white problems or minority problems; there are just problems. She can assert that the status quo for white (and nonwhite) working-class people is reinforced not by the pursuit of political correctness, but instead by the propagation of racial divisions between us. By dismissing Trump’s supporters as racist—however rightfully in many cases—Clinton further numbs many white people to the sensitivity with which racism was once regarded. It erects a barrier between Clinton’s pursuit of equal justice and the defensive holdouts with whom she must ultimately cooperate to achieve her vision of social progress. Silencing and demonizing Trump’s supporters as racists simplistically shuns them into the ideological silos that segregate our society. We will never find common ground if we don’t share space.",true
"(CNN)Former President George H.W. Bush said Monday that he will vote for Hillary Clinton in November, according to sources close to the 41st President -- an extraordinary rebuke of his own party's nominee. The sources said this was not the first time Bush had disclosed his intention to vote for Clinton. The comments came during a receiving line for board members of the bipartisan Points of Light Foundation when Bush was speaking to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, Robert F. Kennedy's daughter and the former Maryland lieutenant governor. There were roughly 40 people in the room, and it's not clear how many people heard him, though multiple sources did. The Republican former president's embrace of the Democratic nominee represents a dramatic new chapter in the complicated three-decade-old relationship between the two most prominent families in American politics. It's a stunning political move -- one that comes just 49 days from the election, and less than a week before Clinton and Donald Trump square off in their first debate. Trump's campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told CNN's Erin Burnett Tuesday that she respects ""the 92-year-old former president very much and his decision."" ""It is ironic that he would vote for the wife of the man who knocked him out of the race,"" she added on ""Erin Burnett OutFront."" ""But look, this was a bruising primary ... so I know there are a lot of hurt feelings there."" News of his support for Clinton came first on Facebook, when Kennedy Townsend posted a photo of herself with George H.W. Bush, along with the caption: ""The President told me he's voting for Hillary!!"" Kennedy Townsend sits on the advisory board of the Points of Light Foundation. Bush family representatives declined to respond publicly. ""The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim,"" Bush spokesman Jim McGrath said in a statement. But sources with knowledge of the conversation told CNN they were surprised and disappointed that Kennedy Townsend had publicly shared a private conversation with the former president. Kennedy Townsend declined to comment through a spokesman at the Rock Creek Group, where she works as managing director. She later took down the Facebook post. GOP's Trump divide Trump's controversial candidacy has split the group of former Republican nominees. Mitt Romney has hammered Trump in speeches and on Twitter, calling him unfit for office. But former Kansas Sen. Bob Dole has endorsed Trump, as has Arizona Sen. John McCain -- though somewhat reluctantly, often referring to ""the Republican nominee"" rather than Trump by name. Neither George H.W. Bush nor George W. Bush had weighed in on the general election -- even as Trump savaged George W. Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq. However, many of the 41st and 43rd presidents' Cabinet secretaries and national security officials have backed Clinton. George H.W. Bush national security adviser Brent Scowcroft endorsed Clinton in June, saying she ""has the wisdom and experience to lead our country at this critical time."" George W. Bush Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez said on CNN in August that he ""would have preferred Jeb Bush, but I think Hillary is a great choice. I am afraid of what Donald Trump would do to this country."" And Louis Wade Sullivan, the Health and Human Services secretary under George H.W. Bush and the only African-American in his Cabinet, said this month that ""though my enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton is somewhat tempered, I certainly believe she is an infinitely better choice for president than Donald Trump."" But George H.W. Bush isn't speaking for his entire family. Marvin Bush, the former president's youngest son, has said he would vote for Libertarian Gary Johnson. George P. Bush, George H.W. Bush's grandson, has backed Trump. And Jeb Bush, Trump's former primary rival, has said he won't vote for Trump or Clinton. A representative for George W. Bush wouldn't comment on Kennedy Townsend's Facebook post or how George H.W. Bush would vote. The representative simply said George W. Bush is ""spending his time working to keep the Senate in Republican hands and is not commenting on the presidential campaign."" The Bush-Clinton relationship The evolving relationship between the Bush and Clinton families began in 1992, when Bill Clinton ran against -- and defeated -- incumbent President George H.W. Bush. Eight years later, with Clinton term-limited out of office, Bush's son, then-Texas Gov. George W. Bush, succeeded Clinton on a pledge to ""restore honor and dignity"" to the White House -- a not-so-subtle knock on Clinton's marital infidelity. But Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush have also spent their post-presidencies teaming up for philanthropic endeavors. And in recent years, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have increasingly appeared together. The two grew so close that George W. Bush has referred to Clinton as his ""brother from another mother,"" and Clinton has said the two bonded over becoming grandfathers. A Bush-Clinton matchup Early in the 2016 campaign cycle, it appeared the two families could be headed for another showdown with the presidency on the line: Hillary Clinton was seeking the Democratic nomination, while former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- the 41st president's son and the 43rd president's brother -- was a Republican candidate and a fundraising powerhouse. Even if George H.W. Bush hadn't endorsed Hillary Clinton, it was hard to envision him backing Trump. Neither of the former Bush presidents attended the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, where Trump became the GOP's nominee -- with the Bush family staying out of presidential politics after Jeb Bush, denounced repeatedly by Trump as ""low-energy,"" exited the race. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to clarify the context in which George H.W. Bush made his comment about voting for Hillary Clinton. CNN's Daniella Diaz contributed to this report.",fake
"The “designated survivor” has long been one of Washington’s favorite parlor games—imagining what America would be like if a catastrophe befell the capital during a State of the Union and the most powerful office in the land were delivered unwittingly to the cabinet official who had been hidden away as the president-of-last-resort. What would America have looked like under President Jeh Johnson (2016)? President Ernest Moniz (2014)? Or even President Alberto Gonzales (2007)? And then there are the weirder examples: In 2001, had a catastrophe occurred during the inauguration, Americans expecting Republican President George W. Bush might have instead found themselves with a Democratic president named Larry Summers. The idea is startling enough to fuel a new Kiefer Sutherland TV drama, Designated Survivor, in which the 24 actor plays a hapless Housing and Urban Development Secretary who finds himself ushered into the White House after a catastrophic attack on the Capitol. Story Continued Below You might assume that for something as important as presidential succession, the world's most powerful nation has it down to a science. That’s the scenario that Hollywood lays out in the show premiere tonight: Sutherland, who just minutes before had been headed to political obscurity in a low-profile ambassadorship, is instead ushered into the White House by an efficient set of government minders. But in reality, the system is far less clearly delineated, and dogged by questions that are likely to begin the moment it’s pressed into action. I’ve spent the last three years researching a forthcoming book on the government’s doomsday plans, and one fact that emerged starkly is just how uncertain the whole process is. The system of presidential succession is relatively new, and in many cases it's surprisingly unclear who becomes president. As legal scholar Akhil Amar, who had long studied the legalities of succession, told Congress during one hearing after 9/11, “The current Presidential succession Act, 3 U.S.C. section 19, is in my view a disastrous statute, an accident waiting to happen. It should be repealed and replaced.” Indeed, the presidential succession plan is the rare Washington story that’s even stranger—and contains even more unexpected twists—than the Hollywood version. For one thing, the system, known as “continuity of government,” is vastly larger and more complicated than most people realize. While attention usually focuses on the main presidential successor, during high-profile events a much broader shadow government often waits in secure undisclosed locations. During President Obama’s inauguration in 2009, when Defense Secretary Robert Gates was the designated presidential successor, James Clapper—then the undersecretary of defense for intelligence—waited out the swearing-in at the Pentagon’s secret Cold War bunker in Pennsylvania known as Raven Rock, ready to step into Gates’ role as defense secretary if the need arose. But the even weirder thing is what might happen after a disaster. In fact, had Gates emerged from a cave to claim the presidency on January 20, 2009, it might’ve only marked the opening gambit in a legal drama that could have played out for days, weeks, or even months as a variety of officials from all three branches of government argued over who could rightfully claim the presidency. *** For about three hours the designated survivor teeters on the edge of becoming the most important person in the world. That moment in the spotlight—or, more accurately, far from the spotlight—can be brief. The night in 1997 Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman served as the “designated survivor” during one of President Clinton’s addresses to Congress, Glickman went to New York for the night, with a security detail and the nation’s nuclear codes in tow, only to find that as soon as the speech was finished—and the need for a successor over—the security apparatus abandoned him, leaving him in the rain to catch his own taxi home. The idea of a “designated survivor” was formalized by the Carter and Reagan administrations, as White House officials worried about nuclear missiles aboard Soviet submarines that lay off the Atlantic Coast and could have devastated the capital with barely 10 minutes’ notice. President Carter’s White House Military Office in April 1980 had instituted new procedures with FEMA to monitor the attendance of all presidential successors “at major, publicly announced functions outside the White House complex.” While such gatherings of the U.S. leadership had been commonplace in the past—at inaugurations, states of the union, state funerals and the like—the rising tensions of the Cold War made government planners questions their wisdom. “The situation provides an inviting target to enemy attack or terrorist activity, and represents an unnecessary risk to national leadership,” the White House Military Office wrote, outlining the new procedures. The 25th Amendment—itself a modern relic of the Cold War and fears of nuclear attack—lays out a seemingly clear line for presidential succession. It flows from the vice president to the House speaker to the Senate president pro tem, then through the cabinet in the order in which the departments were created—a quirk that itself makes the Department of Homeland Security secretary, one of the people best qualified to actually assume the presidency in a disaster, actually last in line. When all those in the line of succession were gathered in a high-profile setting, FEMA was to notify the White House and an aide would recommend to the president which qualified cabinet successors should skip the event. (Constitutionally, foreign-born cabinet secretaries, like current Interior Secretary Sally Jewell—a Brit!—don’t serve in the line of succession.) It falls to a little-known branch of FEMA, the Central Locator Service, to track the whereabouts of the successors daily, and once a month, after the fact, audit a single day to determine whether it had correctly known where each cabinet member was. The new White House and FEMA procedures got their first test at Reagan’s inaugural. The incoming and outgoing administrations had agreed that Carter’s outgoing defense secretary, Harold Brown, would remain in office past the standard noon departure and ensure that there was a national leader in case something catastrophic happened at the ceremony. “Both sides agreed that something should be done,” a FEMA official explained later. Brown only resigned later on inauguration day once the Reagan team was firmly in control of government’s levers. The “designated survivor” program would grow more formal in the years to come—the chosen Cabinet member would receive a Secret Service detail for the length of the event and a White House military aide would arrive for the evening with one of the emergency briefcases known as the “Football,” which contain instructions on how to access the nation’s nuclear weapons codes—in case the unthinkable happened and the designated survivor needed to be ready to launch an attack. The “designated survivor” program, though, raised a new problem: How would the “designated survivor” prove he or she was actually now the president? The government lacked simple procedures for figuring out how to double-check that person’s identity after a decapitation event. Is the person at the other end of the phone really Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack (State of the Union 2012)? “One of the things we discovered is that there was no authentication system,” Reagan’s first FEMA head Louis Giuffrida said in 1981. “If a successor got on the horn and said, ‘I’m the successor,’ and somebody said ‘Prove it,’ [no one could]. So we’re working on that, and FEMA will be the authenticating mechanism to say, ‘Yeah, this guy’s for real. The president’s gone and we don’t know where the vice president is…and this is the man.’” In the years ahead, FEMA and the White House worked out an elaborate (and classified) system through which a successor would be able to confirm his or her identity, and in subsequent years the “designated survivors” became a common part of Washington lore, and often yielded amusing stories from those who served. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala recounted the story of how she watched the 1996 State of the Union from the White House and ordered pizza. “I took my staff with me and I ordered pizza for them in the Roosevelt Room,” she said years later. “I went to the Oval Office and for one minute sat in the president's chair and then I got up respectfully and went to watch the speech with my staff.” Yet, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, a bipartisan commission examining the nation’s succession planning found that odd—and troubling—quirks persisted that could lead to serious constitutional quandaries in just the sort of situation that Kiefer Sutherland’s character, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Tom Kirkman, experiences in the TV show. As clear as the line of succession may appear on paper, legally it would likely prove a much messier proposition the further down the list you go and cabinet officials become involved. And it could get particularly tangled if the president or vice president is only “incapacitated,” rather than killed outright. It’s not entirely clear, even, that the House speaker or the Senate president pro tem could legally serve as president. Republican Senator John Coryn raised the question during the debate in the early 2000s of what would happen if a speaker of the House or Senate president pro tem ascended to the presidency—and then was challenged by the secretary of state who argued that the legislators didn’t count as constitutional officers, making them ineligible to serve in the presidency. “Believe it or not, the secretary actually has a rather strong case, in my view,” Cornyn said. No less an authority than James Madison himself had argued that the congressional leaders were legislators, not constitutional officers, and thus ineligible to succeed to the presidency. As Cornyn said, “Who is the president? Whose orders should be followed by our armed forces, by our intelligence agencies and by domestic law enforcement bureaus? If law suits are filed, will courts accept jurisdiction? How long will they take to rule? How will they rule? And how will their rulings be respected?” In the years after 9/11, the so-called “Continuity of Government Commission,” pushed by American Enterprise Institute scholar Norm Ornstein, who has assumed the role of Washington’s succession Cassandra and has spent much of the last 20 years raising troubling questions about the 25th Amendment’s ambiguities, confronted one of the strangest and most nettlesome phrases in “COG” operations. It’s a seemingly unnecessary aside in the language guiding presidential succession known as the “supplantation clause,” which held that a “prior-entitled” presidential successor, that is someone who ranks higher in the official line of succession, could supplant a lower-level Cabinet official who was serving as “acting president.” For instance, in a situation where the president and the congressional leadership was killed, but the vice president only incapacitated, the secretary of state would presumably serve as “acting president” until the vice president was able to resume his or her responsibility and become the president. But the “supplantation clause” inserted unhelpful ambiguity: Could, after Congress reconstitutes itself, a newly elected speaker of the House or Senate president pro tem insist on replacing the secretary of state even after that person had assumed the office of “acting president”? Could a newly elected speaker supplant a president pro tem? Might the presidency swing wildly in a few days, at the height of a crisis, between different officials and different political parties? The Continuity of Government Commission tried also to tackle an ongoing problem with presidential succession that had dogged the debate for decades: Even with the idea of designated survivors for major high-profile gatherings and all the evacuation systems in place, on a day-to-day basis everyone in the presidential line of succession lives and works in a tiny radius extending a few miles around the White House and the Capitol. “In the nightmare scenario of terrorists detonating a nuclear device, it is possible that everyone in the line of succession might be killed,” the commission’s executive director, John Fortier, told Congress during one hearing. “Imagine the aftermath: a parade of generals, governors, and under secretaries claiming to be in charge.” It would be the chaos of Al Haig’s “I’m in control here” statement during the Reagan administration writ larger and more fraught. One proposal, floated during the post-9/11 discussions, would have created a “First Secretary,” a Cabinet official who would have been first-in-line to the presidency after the vice president and whose sole responsibility would be to remain outside of Washington and be the designated survivor to head the shadow government if a catastrophic event destroyed the capital. It would be a job, in essence, to remain in an “undisclosed location” until the worst moment of American history. * * * Such questions make the nation, under existing rules, particularly vulnerable during presidential inaugurations. The terms of the president and vice president constitutionally expire at noon on January 20th, but their cabinets remained in office until either a resignation is tendered or a successor is confirmed by the Senate—which usually doesn’t happen for hours or even days after an inauguration. In 2001, as Fortier, the commission leader explained, a terror attack that targeted George W. Bush’s inauguration, might have left the nation with a president carried over from the previous administration who would then serve until Congress had a speaker or president pro tem who would “bump” out the president and serve the rest of the four-year term of office. Fortier said, “A country expecting Republican George W. Bush to take office would have found themselves with a Democratic President Larry Summers. As secretary of the treasury, Summers was the highest-ranking Clinton Cabinet member eligible to serve as President.” In 1989, at George H.W. Bush’s inauguration, the situation would have been even more confusing, with the same strange outcome: Michael Armacost, the number three official at Reagan’s State Department, would have been elevated to president of the United States, for the outgoing secretary of state, George Shultz, and deputy secretary of state, John C. Whitehead, had both resigned before the inauguration. Then, with the House in Democratic hands, a newly chosen speaker could have bumped Armacost and given the nation four years of Democratic rule immediately after it elected a Republican president. In fact, given that the Senate took five days to confirm James Baker as secretary of state after Bush’s inauguration, Armacost remained fourth in line to the presidency for the better part of a week. Armacost went on to serve as president of the Brookings Institution and Summers went on to serve as president of Harvard University, so both men ended up with the title of “President,” but—had an unprecedented crisis summoned them to lead in 1989 or 2001—it’s hard to imagine that the ascension of either man to the American presidency would have proved reassuring to the nation in its moment of need. Unless Kiefer Sutherland’s drama reopens the debate, there are no plans to fix any of these—or a host of other—problems with presidential succession. Congress tabled and ignored the fixes on the table a decade ago, and except for a few lonely congressional voices in the years since, like Rep. Brian Baird, there’s been little attention since. So, as you tune in to watch Kiefer Sutherland heroically step in and lead the nation on TV, know that you’re perhaps watching the ultimate Hollywood fiction: The idea that the government’s Doomsday plans would actually work.",true
"Even as law enforcement continues to investigate a series of bombings over the weekend in and around New York City, President Barack Obama said Monday that military successes against the Islamic State have exposed the militant group “as the failed cause that it is.” The president declined to offer specifics of the investigation into the bombings, referring reporters to the FBI and other law enforcement agencies for updates. But as the president was speaking, NBC News and other media outlets began reporting that Ahmad Rahami, a man wanted in connection with the bombings, had been taken into custody. Story Continued Below Law enforcement has not publicly tied Rahami, a U.S. citizen of Afghan descent, to any terrorist group but in his public statement Monday, Obama spoke not just about the investigation into the weekend’s attacks but also the global fight to combat terrorist groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda. “We will continue to lead the global coalition on the fight to destroy ISIL, which is instigating a lot of people over the Internet to carry out attacks. We are going to continue to go after them. We're going to take out their leaders, we're going to take out their infrastructure,” the president said from New York, where he will attend the United Nations General Assembly meeting later this week. “As we take away more of their territory, it exposes ISIL as the failed cause that it is. And it helps to undermine their ideology which over time will make it harder to recruit and inspire people to violence.” Speaking specifically to the ongoing investigation into the bombings in New York and New Jersey, the president said he had been briefed by FBI Director James Comey and had spoken with New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The president also said that a “particularly high level of federal resources” were already in place in New York to assist with the UN General Assembly and that those resources would be able to assist in the investigations. Recalling his conversations with governors Cuomo and Christie, Obama praised New Yorkers and New Jerseyans for their toughness: “Folks around here, you know, they don’t get scared. They are tough. They are resilient. They go about their business every single day.” “That kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life. That's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American,” the president said. “By showing those who want to do us harm that they will never beat us, by showing the entire world that as Americans we do not and never will give in to fear, that's going to be the most important ingredient in us defeating those who would carry out terrorist acts against us.”",true
"Washington (CNN)At a rally in North Carolina on Tuesday, Donald Trump, the Republican nominee states: ""Our African American communities are absolutely in the worst shape they've ever been in before. Ever, ever, ever."" The statement is so patently absurd, fact-checking it seems kind of silly. But rather than just give the general response of ""What about slavery?"" or ""How about segregation?"" or ""How about when black people couldn't vote?"" a couple of empirical data points and a bit of history provide just a few examples of how wrong the statement is. Consider: - A number of black men have been shot and killed by police officers in recent years. That is tragic. But between 1882 and 1931, there were 3,318 black people lynched. That's, on average, more than 1 black person strung up without a trial every week during a 50-year-period. - Last year 32.7% of black children lived in families with incomes below the poverty line. Pretty horrible. But in 1965, it was 65.6% of all black kids who were living in poverty. - The shooting of an unarmed black man in Tulsa is horrible. But in 1921, marauding white mobs, some dropping dynamite from airplanes, killed scores of black people - some estimates range up to 300 - in Tulsa's Greenwood neighborhood. Authorities detained more than 6,000 black folks just to protect them from being slain. History is loaded with examples of how while things may be tough for black people now, times were infinitely more difficult in the past.  ",true
"WSOCTV is now reporting that there is dash cam footage of Keith Scott getting out of his car with a gun in his hand and approaching police officers. The police are not releasing the footage currently… they can’t. This is an internal affairs investigation and the footage will be used in court. Until the attorneys clear it, that video won’t be released. It sounds as though the guy had a thigh holster that had a gun in it that he pulled when he was approached. The excuse he didn’t know they were police officers won’t hold up either… they identified themselves as such when they commanded him to get out of his car. No book was found anywhere. The story his daughter is circulating to gin up racial animosity and riots is a lie.  From Gateway Pundit: Charlotte police reportedly have video of Keith Scott exiting his car, moving toward police officers, with a gun in his hand. And now race protesters are beating cops, tackling reporters, rioting and looting stores. Including the Hornets team store at the arena. […] The protest leaders are encouraging the community to fight back. After Keith Scott came after a cop with a gun and was shot dead. […] Keith Scott wasn’t holding a book. He was holding a gun and had a holster strapped to his leg. Currently, one protester is hanging on to life in critical condition after a second night of rioting. He was shot in the head by another protester. Cops and protesters have both been sent to hospitals and the violence is getting worse. The governor has now declared an emergency in Charlotte and the National Guard have been called in. A curfew is being considered as well. Scott charged those officers before he was shot and killed. Chief Kerr Putney told reporters on Wednesday that Officer Brentley Vinson saw Scott with a handgun and that Scott would not drop it after being ordered to do so. The officer that shot him followed procedure and did the right thing here. But it hardly matters… any excuse will do… any lie will do to start a race war and a riot. Charlotte exemplifies that. In the meantime, the riots continue and it is only a matter of time at this rate until someone is killed. Looting is rampant and the media have been attacked and brutalized. A photographer was shoved to the ground and then protesters tried to throw him into a fire. This is the chaos and violence Obama has been fomenting in our streets. It’s about to explode massively.

"The pro-gun crowd loves guns first, and respect last. At least, that seems to be the case with whoever made a truly horrible meme out of an old black-and-white war photo. The photo depicts troops executing a couple of people in the back as they kneel in front of a mass grave. The troops âare just obeying orders,â and the dead in the mass grave are âcitizens obeying gun laws.â This is the meme:  We donât know who created this, but we donât have enough middle fingers to express how we feel about them. The piece of shit behind this is no doubt someone who believes the lie that, had the Jewish citizens of Germany and elsewhere just had guns, the Holocaust wouldnât have happened. The photo in the meme is from the German-occupied Soviet Union, and depicts one of the mobile execution squads known as the. They were tasked with mass executions of Jews, communists, and anyone else that the Nazis decided werenât suitable to living their empire and master race. Tens of thousands were murdered this way â they are part of the Holocaust. The myth of guns and the Holocaust is so completely and terribly wrong it defies description. Yes, the Nazis seized guns from their enemies, however, they actually didnât make much of a dent in total gun circulation in Germany, contrary to what the gun-rights crowd wants us to believe. Furthermore, the Nazis actually loosened gun laws in 1938 for everyone except Jews. People who have a basic understanding of Nazi Germany know that the Nazis targeted more groups than Jews, and they know that more people than Jews opposed the Nazis however quietly they had to. Why didnât those people, who own guns, rise up? Itâs because of the power of a police state â the very thing the âmoar gunzâ crowd fears the most. Therefore, the cretin who came up with this meme can rightfully be termed as having no clue what they are talking about. But worse than that, That is just abominable, and has no place in any discourse at all. Hereâs why: âThis historical second-guessing is deeply offensive to Jews, Holocaust survivors and those who valiantly fought against Hitler during World War II. It is, in fact, as many historians haveÂ previously noted, a distortion of history itselfâ¦ â¦When you manipulate the history of the Holocaust and use it to score political points, its wholly inappropriate and offensive. Especially for the sake of the victims of the Nazi onslaught and their memory, it must stop.â Thatâs from Jonathan Greenblatt, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League. He was speaking against Ben Carsonâs painfully offensive assertion that the Nazis had disarmed everyone so they could kill Jews with impunity, but itâs just not true. And itâs an serious affront to every single victim of the Nazis, as well as everyone who fought them. This memeâs creator ought to go back to the depths of the hellish abyss that first spat him out. ",true
"The reliably liberal editorial board of the Los Angeles Times has endorsed Hillary Clinton, calling her ""an experienced, thoughtful and deeply knowledgeable public servant"" in a lengthy editorial. The paper lambasted Donald Trump, by contrast, as a ""thin-skinned demagogue who is unqualified and unsuited to be president."" Story Continued Below Echoing criticisms leveled by Clinton and her allies, the editorial attacks the billionaire businessman as someone who ""has never held elected office and has shown himself temperamentally unfit to do so. ""He has run a divisive, belligerent, dishonest campaign, repeatedly aligning himself with racists, strongmen and thugs while maligning or dismissing large segments of the American public. Electing Trump could be catastrophic for the nation,"" the board writes. The editorial then goes on detail Clinton's perceived strengths and attack Trump's record at length. But it also wrestles with the former secretary of state's perceived shortcomings, noting her ""penchant for secrecy"" and dinging her ""for adjusting her positions to match popular opinion and for being a little too comfortable with the use of military force."" Ultimately, the board concludes: ""To be a great president, she will have to struggle to overcome her own weaknesses. But compared with Trump’s infirmities as a candidate, her failings are insignificant.

"Eric Trump tried to spin a tale on Fox news about how his father started with nothing to build a business empire, only to be smacked down with a reminder that Donald Trump started out as a millionaire. The Republican nominee’s demon spawn appeared on on Friday and attempted to portray his dad as just a normal guy who started with nothing in his journey to live the American dream. After trashing Hillary Clinton as not being relatable to millennial voters, Eric Trump was asked to explain how his father is relatable to them. And his answer was an effort to rewrite the reality of his dad’s life. “He’s built an amazing company. He’s become the epitome of the American dream.” Eric Trump said. “He’s gone from practically nothing to a man who’s just…” But that was a total lie and Julie Roginsky didn’t let the younger Trump get away with it. Roginsky cut Eric Trump off and reminded him that his father got $1 million from his father Fred Trump to start out with. Nothing?” Roginsky said. “He got a million bucks. Come on, Eric.” Indeed, Donald Trump grew up the son of one of the richest men in America. He has never known poverty in his entire life. In 1978, he was given $1 million by his father, an amount that Trump called a “small loan” moments after he claimed that life “hasn’t been easy for me” during a town hall event in October 2015. Of course, that’s an insult to the millions of Americans who live in poverty daily and can’t even get a real small loan to lift themselves out of it. They struggle to put food on the table and to pay the bills, but Donald Trump had everything he could ever want and all the opportunities money could buy. Trump’s dad also started a million dollar trust fund for him and left him a multi-million dollar inheritance when he died. In other words, Donald Trump knows absolutely NOTHING about starting from nothing. But Eric Trump didn’t address Roginsky’s reminder and just continued trying to sell his dad as a man who pulled himself up by his bootstraps. “He epitomized what America’s all about: Opportunity and working hard and being able to achieve your dreams and what you want to succeed, right?” Eric Trump continued. “It’s no different than a Zuckerberg, right, who went out with a great idea like a Facebook and developed this idea and built it and grew it and grew it and grew it. That is achieving something, right? And I think it’s very different than a person who has been a career politician.” Here’s the video via VidMe.  Can no member of Trump’s family actually refrain from lying about their past? Because it’s clear that Donald Trump and his children do not understand what it is like to grow up poor. They have had everything given to them on a golden platter and they’ve never had to work a real job a day in their lives. But for some reason, they think $1 million is the definition of starting with nothing. ",true
"Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus appeared on CNN’s pre-Presidential Debate coverage Monday afternoon, absurdly joking with Wolf Blitzer that the Republican Party’s presidential candidate was ready for the debates because “he’d already been through 14 season finales” of Trump’s reality TV show The Apprentice. Of course, it makes absolutely no sense to equate a gaudy half-hour of programming that loosely classifies as entertainment with what is arguably the hardest and most significant hurdle in the journey to becoming the most powerful elected official on the planet, but false-equivalency is after all, the biggest theme of this election. In his latest act “The Donald,” who is apparently “not a fan of mock debates” because “he can get bored,” has decided to eschew traditional methods of debate preparation, instead opting to watch footage of Mrs. Clinton’s best and worst debate moments to look for vulnerabilities. When asked about Trump’s preparation for the debates, Priebus didn’t appear to be concerned about how Trump would perform at the debates, “He’s very comfortable,” Priebus said. “He did a great job in our primary debates. He will be prepared. He’s always shown up for the big dance.” Although Blitzer attempted to press Priebus for more specific details on how Trump is preparing for the debate, the RNC chair would not budge, saying he “didn’t want to get into all those details,” and changing the conversation to discuss the Clinton campaign instead. The Trump-Clinton debate will be at Hofstra University in Hempstead, NY Monday night at 9:00 PM EST and will be broadcast across all the major networks. It is expected to be the most viewed television debate of all time, and could reach up to 100 million viewers, almost certainly affecting the outcome of the November election. Donald Trump made a name for himself in the fact-free zones that were the Republican primary debates, where a group of neocons, corporate shills, and religious extremists argued over who was willing to murder more Middle Eastern people and who hated government the most. Trump thrived by being a bully, making fun of his opponents and literally talking about the size of his penis. He’s not going to be able to get away with that tonight.

"New York (CNN)President Barack Obama worked to calm Americans' jitters Monday after a series of attempts at mass violence, suggesting that yielding to fear amounted to a win for terrorists. During two appearances in New York, Obama praised the swift work of law enforcement authorities looking into duel bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey over the weekend. And he urged Americans to follow the lead of residents here by not submitting to fear. ""I think it is important to remember what terrorists and violent extremists are trying to do. They are trying to hurt innocent people, but they also want to inspire fear in all of us, and disrupt the way we live to undermine our values,"" Obama said. ""We all have a role to play as citizens in making sure that we don't succumb to that fear. And there is no better example of that than the people of New York and New Jersey."" ""Folks around here, you know, they don't get scared. They are tough, they are resilient, they go about their business every single day. And that kind of toughness and resoluteness and a recognition that neither individuals nor organizations like ISIL can ultimately undermine our way of life,"" Obama said. ""That's the kind of strength that makes me so proud to be an American.""

Monday afternoon, Obama said he'd spoken with law enforcement officers who helped apprehend Ahmad Khan Rahami, a suspect in this weekend's bomb attacks in New York and New Jersey, and hailed their actions as heroic. He also said he phoned an off-duty officer who neutralized the attacker in Minnesota. ""It's just one more reminder of the skill and sacrifice and what they put on the line every single day to make sure we're safe,"" Obama said following talks with Iraq's prime minister Haider al-Abadi. An ISIS wing claimed responsibility for the Minnesota attack, though Obama avoided pinning any specific motivation on the attacks during his appearances on Monday. He did, however, insist his administration was going after the terror group aggressively to prevent any further violence. ""We will continue to lead the global coalition on the fight to destroy ISIL, which is instigating a lot of people over the internet, to carry out attacks,"" Obama said, using the administration's term for the Islamic State group. ""We are going to continue to go after them. We're going to take out their leaders, we're going to take out their infrastructure."" Following his talks with Abadi, Obama conceded retaking Iraq's second largest city from the terror group would be difficult. ""This is going to be challenging,"" Obama said of long-held plans to liberate Mosul. ""We feel confident that we will be in a position to move forward fairly rapidly."" ""It will be a tough fight...This is going to be hard, this is going to be challenging,"" Obama continued, adding he would support and assistance from other countries and from US lawmakers. ",true

"The Republican witch hunt to make the IRS commissioner pay for…something… backfired in spectacular fashion after Democrats, insulted at having been dragged into this show trial, took the opportunity to instead flip the script. During IRS Commissioner John Koskinen’s hearing, Democrats began ignoring the “impeachment” nonsense and focused entirely on getting to the bottom of Donald Trump’s numerous tax scandals, including specific questions about his tax returns and charity fraud. Of particular interest was Trump’s stated excuse for not releasing his tax returns because he is under audit. Tax experts have long noted that this argument is complete nonsense. An audit does not preclude the ability to show the American people your finances before an election. The head of the IRS – who presumably knows a thing or two about this – agreed. “Is there anything that would prohibit someone from releasing tax returns, if they want to, because they’re under audit?” Rep. Jerry Nadler, a Democrat from New York asked. “No,” Koskinen responded simply. Another Democratic representative asked it another way. “Would releasing the person’s tax return during the audit in any way impact that pending audit of the return?” Rep. Ted Deutch asked. “The release itself wouldn’t. The concern sometimes by taxpayers is that when the information is public there may be more information that will be discovered or provided,” Koskinen said. In other words, Trump was worried that releasing his tax returns could make him look bad, or possibly allow nosy reporters to find even more criminality that the IRS missed the first time. This answer actually confirms what Trump’s son suggested to reporters in an unusual break from his dad. It wasn’t the audit that scares Trump, it’s that reporters seeing the tax returns would allow them to discover what’s in them and that would destroy his father’s chances of becoming president. It may be for this reason that Trump has hinted he will only release his tax returns after the election. It won’t matter then. The beatings continued in earnest while Republicans were forced to sit there with “What have we done?” expressions painted on their faces. Democrats then went on to highlight some of the items that could prove problematic for Trump to disclose, such as his actual income, what he pays the government in taxes, clues to his actual net worth and records of his charitable giving. Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) wondered aloud if discovering payments by Russia might suggest a monetary ― or even treasonous ― motive for going soft on a U.S. rival. Several also raised the recent reports of Trump using his tax-free foundation to to buy paintings and sports memorabilia, to fund political campaigns and to pay business expenses. “Is it appropriate for a foundation to give political donations?” asked Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas). The answer was no. Rep. Luis Gutierrez smiled in the face of Republican discomfort at the questions while munching on a bag of Skittles (a not-so-subtle nod to Trump Jr.’s recent comparison of Syrian refugees to poisoned candy). He later clarified that, unlike some people, he wouldn’t stop eating Skittles if he got a bad one. It was not a good day to be a Republican lawmaker. The IRS commissioner is facing a Republican-orchestrated impeachment due to what they say was a cover up to hide IRS targeting of conservative groups. The minor detail that no evidence of the IRS head actually targeting conservative groups actually exists didn’t seem to bother them. The impeachment hearing, widely agreed to be a dog-and-pony show, came after Republican leaders managed to stop an embarrassing impeachment vote on the House floor which would have humiliated the GOP with yet another stark example for the American voters of how frivolous and dysfunctional the party has become. They settled for grandstanding. So with the knowledge that Republicans were wasting everyone’s time, Democrats decided to use those wasted hours to highlight just how corrupt Donald Trump is.

"Last week I wrote an article titled “Donald Trump’s Amazing Week” which must have been incredibly annoying to liberals and “Never Trumpers” everywhere. Guess what? This past week has been even better for the 2016 Republican nominee for president, the man whose candidacy was considered a vanity exercise a year and a half ago. Well no one is laughing anymore. The latest round of polls shows that the support for the Trump presidency is growing rapidly. The latest Fox News Poll, which was taken from September 11-14, shows Donald Trump polling at 46%, a one-point lead over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton at 45%.  The LA Times/USC poll taken from September 9-15 shows Trump at 47% with a six-point lead over Clinton at 41%. The gap between the two candidates is also narrowing in the key battleground states. The Suffolk University Poll which was taken from September 12-14 shows Trump at 42%, leading by 3 points with Clinton at 39%. The CNN/ORC poll, which was taken September 7-12 shows Trump with a 4-point lead over Clinton in Florida. Clinton still has about a 3-5 point lead over Trump in other key battleground states, including Pennsylvania and Michigan, but those gaps are getting narrower every day. Other states such as Nevada and New Hampshire which were initially perceived to be likely wins for Clinton have moved to the “toss up state” category. Donald Trump also continued his efforts to layout his policy framework with the introduction of another signature platform, his childcare plan at a speech in Aston PA, just outside of Philadelphia.  Spearheaded by his daughter Ivanka Trump, Trump’s childcare policy offers something for everyone across the economic spectrum.  The plan offers six weeks paid maternity leave to all mothers who do not receive this benefit through their employers. This benefit will be funded by closing gaps in our existing unemployment insurance program.  Lower income families will also benefit from the plan’s offering of childcare rebates through the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) program up to $1,200 per year.  Middle class families will benefit from being able to fully deduct all childcare expense on their tax returns.  Families will also have the ability to establish Dependent Care Savings Accounts (DCSAs) to put money aside tax free for childcare. Low income families will receive a 50% match of the first $1000 deposited per year, generating up to an additional $500 per eligible family per year. DCSAs can be applied to pay for childcare, after school enrichment programs and school choice. Families can also use the funds in a DCSA to care for an elderly parent’s expenses including in home nursing and long-term care.  Finally, Trump’s childcare plan provides a tax deduction for stay-at-home parents, effectively eliminating the tax punishment for a parent’s decision to leave the workforce to be a full time caregiver for child or an elderly parent. Donald Trump followed his childcare policy speech with another economics speech to the Economic Club of New York which includes some of New York’s most powerful movers and shakers in the world of business and finance. Trump’s excellent week continued with his visit to the Dr. Oz Show where he released a letter from his long term doctor revealing the results of his most recent medical visit and other relevant pieces of his medical history. Other than carrying an extra 15-20 pounds, Trump appears to be in excellent health. Of course, Trump’s unveiling his medical records on a television show comes on the heels of the recent concerns about Hillary Clinton’s health following her fainting at last week’s September 11 memorial event and the subsequent revelation that she was suffering from pneumonia. Again, only Donald Trump can turn the literal opening of an envelope into an event. Well, it is an event alright particularly if that envelope is opened on The Dr. Oz Show, a program which is reportedly watched by four million viewers daily with a large percentage of female viewers. During the one hour program, the discussion of Trump’s health was followed by the appearance of Ivanka Trump who was able to deliver yet another pitch about the newly announced childcare proposal to the aforementioned audience of women.  So yes, somehow all this concern about Hillary Clinton’s health and capacity to serve as president has created multiple free publicity events for Donald Trump. Trump followed up the Dr. Oz interview with a visit to the Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. During the visit, Trump permitted the late night comedian to do something “unpresidential”. That is to say, he told Fallon that he could “mess up his hair”.  While most pundits would speculate that the moment was completely pre-planned,  the fact that Trump said “yes” to the display speaks volumes.  He demonstrated that he has the ability to laugh at himself and that he is not afraid to have a bad picture taken. Furthermore, The Tonight Show is popular with Democrats and millennials of all political persuasions. Once again, Trump had an opportunity to make a connection with millions of people who more than likely were not on the “Trump Train”.  Oh and one more thing, by letting Jimmy Fallon touch his hair on national television, Trump has finally set to rest all rumors that his hair is not his.  However small, it’s another check mark in the honesty and transparency box. Now if all of this was not enough, Donald Trump capped his week off with an opening event ceremony at his new hotel in the former post office site in Washington DC where he received endorsements from military flag officers and fourteen Medal of Honor recipients.  Trump used the event to not only promote his hotel project as being completed “two years early and under budget”, a metaphor for how he would manage the US economy, he also seized the moment to put an end to the “birther issue”.  Trump took the microphone and said “Not to mention her in the same breath,” (as the Medal of Honor recipients who had just endorsed him) “Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it,” he said. “President Barack Obama was born in the United States, period. Now we all want to get back to making America strong and great again.” Trump said. Once again, political correctness be damned, Donald Trump has had another “amazing week.”  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.",true
"The Black Lives Matter movement is quick to cry foul whenever black people appear to be stereotyped. But what about situations when all the facts point to gang-related activity that is clearly racial and occurs against whites? That was the case in Atlanta, Georgia several weeks ago when a black gang entered the home of an 83-year-old white woman. That woman, Dorothy Dow, was sleeping in bed when a gang of four black men and women entered her home, beat her and then set her on fire. Dow passed away in the hospital recently from complications from the attack. Her attackers are now being charged with murder. Justin Grady, age 38, Cortavious Deshaun Heard, age 18, Mina Christine Ellery, age 17 and Angel Latrice Harmon age 17 are all being held without bond on charges of ""felony murder and malice murder."" The group entered Dow's home and pulled her from her bed where she was sleeping. One of the gang hit her repeatedly with a pistol, breaking the bones in her hand and her arm. Then Dow was covered in a flammable material and set on fire. She survived burning to death only because she pulled herself to a place where she knew she had kept a gallon jug of water. There she was able to pour the water on herself and put out the fire. Then, with a broken arm, she crawled to her cellphone and dialed 911.   The local news station gives no reasoning about why the attack occurred, but as we well know, had the races been reversed, the entire country would be burning from the Black Lives Matter protests. We need to stop with this duplicitous nature in America. Death is wrong. Violence is wrong. Race shouldn't matter. h/t: CBS Atlanta ",true
"Trumpâs Campaign Manager was interrupted on CNN by Anderson Cooper after she said, âyouâve got all these little baby girls being killed just because theyâre girls in this country.â Without letting her finish, Anderson immediately stopped her: âWait, what Excuse me, where is that happening?â She then went on and tried to back up her statement by citing Planned Parenthood data, which was supposedly collected by the Guttmacher Institute report. But, Anderson Cooper wasnât buying it. âBut statistically, thereâs not really much evidence that that is actually occurring in the United States,â Cooper said. âAmongst some immigrant groups in small numbers it may be occurring but in no statistical measure is it significant.â Then â right after commercial break â Anderson Cooper again came back in order to set the record straight. The only thing Trumpâs campaign manager could do was force a fakeÂ smile. âBefore the break, Kellyanne, you mentioned the Guttmacher Institute information on sex-selective abortion in the United States,â Cooper said. âHereâs what they actually say in a May 30 press release titled âSex Selective Abortion Bans: A Disingenuous New Strategy to Limit Womenâs Access to Abortion.ââ âThe study acknowledges the practice does go on overseas, as we mentioned, and perhaps in certain Asian-American communities in the United States in small numbers,â Copper continued. âBut, quote, âIn the United States, meanwhile, there is limited data indicating that sex-selective abortion may be occurring in some Asian communities. Although the U.S. sex ratio at 1.05 males for every female is squarely within biologically normal parameters.â So I just wanted to put that out there.â ",true
"Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama said Saturday that the new Smithsonian museum devoted to African-American history elevates the often-overlooked impact of black Americans and will help others better understand the breadth of the American story. ""This national museum helps to tell a richer and fuller story of who we are,"" Obama, the first African-American president, said at the National Museum of African-American History and Culture. ""By knowing this other story we better understand ourselves and each other. It binds us together. It reaffirms that all of us are America, that African-American history is not somehow separate from our larger American story,"" he added. ""It is central to the American story."" Saturday's opening ceremony for the museum also was attended by civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis, former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton and Chief Justice John Roberts. Thousands are expected to have descended on the National Mall this weekend to celebrate the museum's opening. Calling it an ""act of patriotism"" to understand African-American history and the struggles of all Americans, Obama said ""a great nation doesn't shy away from the truth."" ""We're not a burden on America or a stain on America or an object of shame and pity for America. We are America,"" Obama said. ""And that's what this museum explains."" ""Hopefully, this museum makes us talk to each other and listen to each other and see each other,"" he added. Obama also said the museum can provide context to the current national debate on the relationship between law enforcement and black communities that recently made headlines following the police shooting deaths of black men in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina. ""Perhaps it can help a white visitor understand the pain and anger of demonstrators in places like Ferguson (Missouri) and Charlotte. But it can also help black visitors appreciate the fact that not only is this younger generation carrying on traditions of the past, but within the white communities across the nation, we see the sincerity of law enforcement officers and officials who, in fits and starts, are struggling to understand and trying to do the right thing,"" he said. ""It reminds us that routine discrimination and Jim Crow aren't ancient history. It's just a blink in the eye of history,"" Obama continued. Star-studded event Saturday's event included musical performances by Stevie Wonder, Patti LaBelle and Denyce Graves, as well as appearances by Robert De Niro and Angela Bassett, who read the words of black poets and historians. RELATED: Congressman: Black history museum is 'an American story' The effort to bring this museum to life began decades ago but was finally set in motion in 2003 when Bush signed a bill creating it. Ground was broken in February 2012. The Smithsonian says the museum is the only one in the US exclusively focused on African-American life, history and culture, but organizers say it is also meant to capture the story of all Americans. One of those who have worked for years to see this museum come to life is educator and historian Lonnie Bunch, founding director for the museum. Asked what does it mean to him to see it finally open, he said, ""It means that finally the African-American story on the National Mall is accessible to everybody, and in many ways it means that my ancestors are smiling,"" he told CNN. ""This is framed in a way that this is everybody's story. It is not a black people's story. It is a story of America."" Slavery and freedom at focus Officials said the chronicling of slavery and freedom are the centerpiece of the museum. That exhibit contains such items as a slave cabin from South Carolina, a bill of sale for a 16-year-old girl for $600, shackles used on slaves and a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation. RELATED: Clinton, Trump navigate politics of police violence There is also an exhibition focusing on the fight against segregation, which discusses the era from end of Reconstruction through the Civil Rights Movement. Here, visitors see such things as abolitionist Harriet Tubman's hymn book to a dress Rosa Parks was making shortly before she was arrested for not giving up her seat on a segregated bus; a Tuskegee airplane used to train African-American pilots for World War II flights; a segregated Pullman train car as well as a stool from the Woolworth store where there were sit-ins in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1960; and separate water fountains. A separate section examines the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Power era of the 1960s and 1970s and other activism remembering many activists, including Lewis and Dr. Martin Luther King. The museum holds more than 3,000 artifacts -- with many contributed from ordinary Americans from across the country. There are also tens of thousands of other artifacts which have been contributed which could be rotated later into exhibition space. Obama on Trump: 'Even most 8-year-olds' know slavery was a bad time for black people There are also many iconic items celebrating the achievements in sports, music, television and film including Michael Jackson's fedora hat worn during his 1984 ""Victory Tour,"" boxer Muhammad Ali's headgear, musician Chuck Berry's Cadillac, baseball star Jackie Robinson's bat, some of Olympian Gabby Douglas' items as well as a statue honoring American athletes who held their hands up as a demonstration of solidarity during the 1968 Gold Medal ceremony. Obama featured One exhibit honors the legacy of Obama's election. During an interview airing Friday, he voiced his appreciation for all of those whose work helped make the museum happen. ""We were an outgrowth of Frederick Douglass and white abolitionists who partnered with him,"" Obama told ABC News. ""We were the consequence of these Freedom Riders. Of all races. Young people idealistically coming down here and being willing to challenge an unjust system."" Also interesting is the design of the building. Sitting next to the Washington Monument on the National Mall, the exterior is made up of 3,600 bronze-colored panels. The architects of the building drew on imagery from both African and American history for the outer layer, saying they were trying to reach towards the sky to express faith, hope and resiliency. The building is three-tiered and is inspired by a traditional wooden column that features a crown or corona -- or African headdress -- at the top. At night, the corona glows from the light within the building. CNN's Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",true
"Hillary Clinton just called out the fact that Donald Trump cheered for the housing crisis in anticipation of its collapse – which is absolutely true. Trump told The Globe and Mail in March of 2007: “People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I’m excited if it is. I’ve always made more money in bad markets than in good markets.” In fact, Trump thought the housing crisis was much-ado-do about nothing for high-end investments, and told investors: “I don’t see the subprime problems affecting the higher-end stuff…In fact, he is advising investors that there are now great deals in buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices.” Of course, on one level, Trump wasn’t wrong­­—in that the subprime crisis affected mostly poorer Americans who lost their homes and jobs and the ability to support their families. The collapse of home prices caused by the housing bubble cost roughly seven million Americans more than $7 trillion in equity during the Great Recession. This recession most severely impacted low-income folks – people who are burdened with payments in excess of 50 percent of their income – Trump’s response is just “That’s called business.”",true
"The San Francisco 49ers are now facing fallout from their decision not to cut backup quarterback Colin Kaepernick.  The Santa Clara police union has reportedly threatened to boycott 49ers games in response to quarterback Colin Kaepernick's refusal to stand during the national anthem and his comments on racial injustice and police brutality. Members of the union wrote a letter to the San Francisco 49ers, which was obtained by KNTV, warning that if the team does not take action against Kaepernick, ""it could result in police officers choosing not to work at your facilities."" The Santa Clara Police Department is the primary law enforcement agency at Levi's Stadium, where the 49ers play. About 70 officers choose work during games and are paid as security personnel. The union says about two-thirds of the officers who work at Levi's Stadium are from Santa Clara. Officers from other departments could be hired if Santa Clara officers decide not to show up, but Saunders says this could create a conflict with the city's contract with the union. Santa Clara Police Chief Michael Sellers urged his officers to avoid the boycott and to put the community's safety first. ""The safety of our community is out highest priority,"" Sellers said in a statement, reports USA Today. ""I will urge the POA leadership to put the safety of our citizens first. I will work with both sides to find a solution. In the meantime, I will ensure we continue to provide a safe environment at Levi's Stadium."" Sellers said that he respects Kaepernick's right to free speech and that he would encourage all officers to respect the rights of all citizens, no matter whether or not they disagree with their opinions. Kaepernick made headlines after speaking out about police brutality and saying that officers ""murder minorities."" He was also photographed wearing socks depicting pigs in police uniforms.

"Clowns are on a rampage along the east coast. Alleged sightings from Pennsylvania down to southern Georgia have parents worried about sending their kids to school. Schools have been closed or put on lockdown after alleged clown threats, including two Alabama schools. According to AL.com: “Irondale [Alabama] police Officer James Lewis, a school resource officer, said a student reported to police that a Facebook post hinted at the possibility of clowns showing up on campus at Shades Valley High School. “There was no threat,” Lewis said. Birmingham police said Holy Family Cristo Rey High School in Ensley received a call that a clown was coming to the school to lure children to the woods. Police found nothing, said Sgt. Bryan Shelton. Similar incidents have taken place throughout Alabama, including Flomaton, Etowah County and Montgomery, and across the southeast. In some instances, children have reported clowns trying to lure them into the woods. In other cases, victims have been messaged by the so-called clowns with vulgar language.” So far, investigators have not been able to find hard evidence that there is any truth to these sightings.

"There were a couple of not-so-very-subtle signals here inside of Hofstra University that Donald Trump lost Monday night’s highly-anticipated debate against Hillary Clinton, and badly. The first was the audible sound of groaning by some of his supporters (picked up by my attentive colleague Steve Shepard) inside the debate hall as Trump meandered self-defensively through a succession of answers against a very focused, very energized and very well-rehearsed Hillary Clinton. Story Continued Below Another tell: After the 90-minute sparring match finished, Clinton’s team practically bounded into the spin room – more in glassy-eyed disbelief than visible elation that things had gone so much better than expected. The GOP nominee’s people, by contrast, dribbled into the media pen like surly seventh-graders headed for homeroom the day before summer vacation. “F—k, let’s do this,” a prominent Trump surrogate said before diving into a scrum. Trump and his new-ish messaging team have labored mightily to turn the avatar of populist rage into a reasonable facsimile of someone who you could see sitting in the Oval Office. But this best-laid plan unraveled on Monday – amid Clinton’s steely assault and the dignified interrogation of NBC’s Lester Holt, who struck a deft balance between facilitator, BS detector and lion tamer. Within minutes of the opening bell, Clinton’s attacks forced domesticated Donald to go feral – he bellowed, interrupted her repeatedly, grunted, and toward the bedraggled end, became muted and pouty. “It was bizarre,” said Barack Obama’s campaign manager David Plouffe, who, like many Clinton allies, seemed visibly relieved. “He was clearly rattled, and clearly focused on defending himself, which I’m told narcissists are prone to do, and he clearly faded at the end. It’s not like she’s going to jump out to a 10-point lead, but this was good.” Whether or not this reverses Trump’s momentum, or reestablishes Clinton's control of the race is an open question. Who won is not. Here are five takeaways. Trump was wimpy when defensive. He is supposed to be the big meanie but it was Clinton who hit him where it hurt most. It doesn’t take a Jung (or even Dr. Phil after a couple of Bud Lights) to figure out that the GOP nominee – who boasts like a barfly – just might be over-compensating. Hence, Clinton, who started the debate a little tentatively, quickly launched into a carefully planned program of Freudian mind-games, contrasting her own middle-class businessman dad (who had his own issues) with Trump’s imperious, larger-than-life father Fred who launched his son’s business career but also was said to be extremely tough on him. First she started in with a paean to her father’s running a small printing business in Chicago (This might be the first time a candidate has described, in detail, the silk-screen squeegee process on a debate stage) – then she pivoted to mocking supposedly self-made Trump’s start in the real estate business. “You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father,” she said icily. “My father gave me a very small loan in 1975 and I built it into a company that's worth many, many billions of dollars,” he responded weakly – and so it went on a range of topics. Whether it was because Clinton was so well prepped, and Trump was so breezily unprepared – or had a simple case of opening night jitters – the bully-boy nominee abandoned his most effective mode of debate combat, answering an attack with a harsher one. She went right for Trump’s ego – questioning his questionable $11 billion net worth, his boastful record on job creation and picking apart his tough talk on fighting ISIS. In 2007, preparing for a primary race she’d eventually lose, Clinton told me that the key to presidential political campaigns was understanding that the most effective attacks weren’t about exploiting someone’s weaknesses but challenging an opponent’s perceived strengths. When confronted with that assault, Trump wilted and offered a series of meandering answers that had his Republicans wincing. “It was a draw,” former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown said. “But he was on the defensive far too much. That’s a direct result of his inexperience.” What about the Clinton Foundation? The former secretary’s debate team (including longtime aide Phillippe Reines, who snapped a pre-debate photo in a Trump circled-finger pose) expected him to savage her on the various questions raised about her family’s foundation. They were worried about it. While he hammered her ever-so-briefly on emails, he was so engaged in self-justification, he flat-out forgot to pursue an attack that could have made the night a lot less lousy. His “30 years” attack worked – and he’ll use it again. Trump may have lost the first debate, but he’s proven to be a fast learner, and is likely to come back stronger in early October for the second debate, a town hall style affair, in St. Louis. And there were a few gold nuggets strewn in the wreckage of Hofstra – the most valuable an assault (demonstrable and fact-checker-friendly) on Clinton’s effectiveness in 25-plus years of public life. The been-there-not-done-that argument was particularly useful when coupled with his usual slams on Bill Clinton’s passage of the increasingly unpopular NAFTA agreement from the 1990s and Hillary Clinton’s election-year flip-flop from TPP booster to opponent. “When she started talking about this, it was really very recently,” Trump said of her opposition to the trade deal. “She's been doing this for 30 years. And why hasn't she made the agreements better? The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons, but just because of the fact.” When Clinton claimed that she planned to “really work to get new jobs and to get exports that helped to create more new jobs.” He scoffed, and shot back, “But you haven't done it in 30 years or 26 years.” Clinton effectively attacked his business career. Trump’s attempt to head off debate-night questions about his five-year campaign promoting the birther slander against Barack Obama was a humbling face-plant. His attempt to pin the origin of the charge against Clinton associate Sid Blumenthal was semi-effective with the political press, but it withered under the insistent interrogation of an African-American moderator determined to extract an apology or reasonable explanation. Trump offered neither – and suggested Obama should actually be grateful he pursued the canard because it’s now been resoundingly put to rest. Politically, his tortured explanation helps energize black voters – who already oppose him in historic numbers. But later in the debate, Clinton plucked the strains of what could be a genuine crossover hit this fall among ever-elusive white working-class voters and independents: Trump’s failure to turn over his tax returns. Clinton went there with a vengeance – engaging in a little Trump-esque fact-free speculation about the motives of the billionaire developer-turned-reality TV star. “So you've got to ask yourself, why won't he release his tax returns?” Clinton mused, with relish. “And I think there may be a couple of reasons. First, maybe he's not as rich as he says he is. Second, maybe he's not as charitable as he claims to be. Third, we don't know all of his business dealings... Or maybe he doesn't want the American people, all of you watching tonight, to know that he's paid nothing in federal taxes, because the only years that anybody's ever seen were a couple of years when he had to turn them over to state authorities when he was trying to get a casino license, and they showed he didn't pay any federal income tax.” Trump’s answer did more harm than good: “That makes me smart,” he said – referring to his business, not his political, acumen. Her most effective attack – and his worst answer. If the GOP nominee needed any more proof that preparation trumps bombast in a general election debate, he got it when Clinton launched a merciless attack on his habit of stiffing contractors who have labored on his construction projects over the years. Again, Clinton brought it back to her father, describing how bad he would have felt if one of his clients had accepted his work without paying his bill. ""I’ve met dishwashers, painters, architects, marble installers, drapery installers, who you refused to pay when they finished the work you asked them to do,” Clinton said, delivering a carefully scripted attack. “We have an architect in the audience who designed one of your clubhouses at one of your golf courses. It's a beautiful facility. It immediately was put to use. And you wouldn't pay what the man needed to be paid, what he was charging you to do.” This is a particular dangerous issue for a candidate whose entire campaign is rooted in fighting for the working class -- and his flippant response, yet again, gave comfort to his enemies. “Maybe he didn't do a good job and I was unsatisfied with his work,” Trump quipped.",true
"What you are about to see is disturbing. Keith Lamont Scott, the man killed by police in Charlotte, North Carolina had an awesome wife of 20 years who narrated and recorded the final tragic moments of his life. Mr. Scott suffered from a traumatic brain injury, and his wife repeatedly told the police this information in the minutes prior to the shooting. She also told them that he had no weapon, and that he had just taken his medication. Of course, the cops just kept shouting at the man to drop the gun that he didn’t have, before taking his life for no reason. Well, the cat’s out of the bag now. NBC News has the video, so, despite the fact that the cops and the City of Charlotte have been refusing to take the public’s demands for transparency seriously, the information is now out there thanks to the bravery of Mrs. Scott. Here is the news report, via NBC:  These cops have a whole hell of a lot of explaining to do on this one. They better release whatever information they have, and they better not try any funny business with cover-ups. This is a damning, disturbing, and heartbreaking video of yet another senseless death of a black man in America at the hands of the system that is supposed to serve and protect.

"There shouldn’t be an estate tax period. Right now the rate stands at 40%. If Hillary Clinton gets her way, she’ll raise it to a whopping 65% and I would not be surprised to see it go even higher. We are being taxed to death and Hillary loves taxes. Taxation equals slavery… it is enforced compliance and I view it as unconstitutional. But these rules don’t apply to elitists such as the Clintons who are now definitely in the top 1% of the wealthy out there. They have several tax shelters that keep this from applying to them. Isn’t that nice? I guess when they kick off, they want to make sure that Chelsea gets their wealth. But it isn’t just the estate tax with these people… they have accounting methods that shield them from almost all taxation.  From Breitbart: Hillary Clinton wants to increase the estate tax to 65 percent on the wealthiest Americans, according to her latest tax plan. The Clinton campaign estimates that the increase would raise an addition $75 billion in revenue over the next decade. The current rate maxes out at 40 percent. But Hillary Clinton and her husband Bill have created a number of tax shelters in recent years to dramatically limit their payment of the very same tax. As Bloomberg reported back in 2014: “To reduce the tax pinch, the Clintons are using financial planning strategies befitting the top 1 percent of U.S. households in wealth.” In 2010 the Clinton created “residential trusts” and the following year moved their Chappaqua estate into the trust, according to their financial records. As David Scott Sloan, a partner at the firm Holland Knight explained the Clinton trust to CBS News, “You’re creating things that are going to be on the nontaxable side of the balance sheet when they die.” The move will save the Clintons hundreds of thousands of dollars in estate taxes, according to accountants quoted by Bloomberg. These types of taxation shelters are common among the wealthy. They do not typically apply to the rest of us. If Clinton could get away with it, she would impose a 100% tax rate. In essence, they are already doing that by using multiple layers of taxation. Creative accounting seems to only apply to the wealthy. Those who see themselves as above the rule of law. Just as Clinton skated on the email scandal and other felonies, she has found a way to shelter her wealth. She’s also adept at money laundering. She’s a multi-talented corrupt barracuda and should be in prison, not running for the presidency.  ",true
"CLEVELAND — Donald Trump campaigned Wednesday morning in a church in a historically African-American community and sold himself as the candidate who could fix the problems of urban America. Within hours, Trump was proposing a vast expansion of “stop-and-frisk” policing policies that have proved explosively controversial in black communities for encouraging racial profiling. It was just another day in Trump’s up-and-down black outreach campaign undertaken to wash away the stain of racism charges lobbed at him by Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. Story Continued Below The effort has taken Trump from a black church in inner-city Detroit earlier this month to addressing largely white audiences in rural North Carolina where, on Tuesday evening, he proclaimed in a small town named after a slaveholder that black communities ""are absolutely in the worst shape that they’ve ever been in before, ever, ever, ever."" On Wednesday, Trump hit the campaign trail with former boxing promoter Don King — who dropped the N-word before a group of pastors at a Cleveland church while extolling Trump as a “gladiator.” King hailed Trump as the rare candidate who would overthrow the existing political system under which minorities have suffered. “The system is the problem, and he’s the only gladiator that will take on the system,” King said. After the church event, Trump sat for a “town hall” with Fox News host and unabashed supporter Sean Hannity. Asked by an audience member what he would do to address “violence in the black community,” Trump embraced stop-and-frisk. “We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well,” Trump said. Fierce opposition to that policy in minority communities was among the issues that Bill de Blasio rode to prominence and, ultimately, the mayor’s office. But even before Trump’s stop-and-frisk comments, he was taking heat for his “ever, ever, ever” remark Tuesday night. “I don't know what Mr. Trump is talking about to say that the situation for African-Americans is worse than it's ever been,” Rep. John Lewis, the Democratic civil rights icon, said Wednesday on MSNBC. “Is he talking about worse than slavery? Worse than the system of segregation and racial discrimination — when we couldn't take a seat at the lunch counter and be served? Worse than being denied the right to register to vote, to participate in the democratic process and live in certain neighborhoods and communities?” Trump’s polling numbers among African-American voters have been dismal — in the low single digits — and some believe his outreach to black voters is as much about convincing moderate white voters, particularly women and those in the suburbs, that he is not racist. Trump regularly brings up his outreach to blacks — “What do you have to lose?” he says — to largely white audiences. At the New Spirit Revival Center in Cleveland, Trump assembled an eclectic kitchen cabinet of some of his closest advisers to attest to his beliefs before a diverse crowd. Seated to Trump’s right was Mike Pence, his soft-spoken running mate. To his left, outspoken longtime attorney Michael Cohen. Behind him: King (“there’s only one,” Trump said), former presidential rival Ben Carson (“tough”), retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn (“a tough general”) and former ""Apprentice"" star Omarosa Manigault (“a wonderful woman”), who has helped with Trump’s black outreach. “I’m different from a lot of Republicans, frankly,” Trump said from the pulpit. Trump, who has called himself the “law and order” candidate, criticized the police officer who shot an unarmed black man in Oklahoma last week. Trump said he had watched the video and that the officer may have been “choking” in the fatal shooting. Trump has mostly defended the police in such incidents. ""Now, did she get scared? Was she choking? What happened? But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, OK?” King, whom top GOP officials had pushed not to speak at the Republican National Convention due to a past manslaughter conviction, was given the prime slot of introducing Trump at a forum billed as a pastors leadership conference. King, clothed in a sparkling jacket and clutching the flags of Israel and the United States, argued repeatedly that “the system” had oppressed minorities and women and only Trump can upend it entirely. “Every white woman should cast a vote for Donald Trump,” said King, who also went on an extended riff about the struggles of African-Americans. “I told Michael Jackson, I said if you're poor, you're a poor Negro — I would use the N-word — but if you rich, you are a rich Negro; if you are intelligent, intellectual, you're an intellectual Negro; if you're a dancing and sliding and gliding n-----, I mean, Negro,” King said. When Trump took his turn at the pulpit minutes later, he grinned, “Ah, there’s only one Don King.” Before King, Cohen, Trump’s attorney, used his time at the church to slash at the “disgusting, liberal, mainstream media” and its casting of Trump as a “racist.” “The word of the 2016 election has somehow become ‘racist,’” Cohen complained. “I’ve lost count as to how many times the disgusting, liberal, mainstream media have attempted to label Mr. Donald Trump as racist, a xenophobe and a bigot. And let’s not forget, sexist, misogynist, narcissist, Islamophobe, anti-Hispanic, anti-Semite demagogue. And countless others. It’s disgraceful.” Cohen said, “Not only is Donald Trump not a racist, he believes that all people are part of one race: the human race.” Trump insisted that Democrats had abandoned black voters, and that he wouldn’t. “They come and they take your vote,” Trump said, “and they say they’ll see you in four years.”",true

"An article by former assistant U.S. attorney Andrew C. McCarthy in National Review on Monday that is critical of Democrat Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton’s counterterrorism efforts has been censored by Twitter as being “unsafe” in their view. The article, titled “The Mulish Stupidity of Clinton-Obama Counterterrorism” when clicked on from Twitter, results in the following ominous-sounding warning:  Andrew McCarthy, who led the 1995 terrorism against  Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman and eleven other radical Islamic terrorists, announced the censorship in a separate post on National Review on Monday evening. In the article, McCarthy makes the point that the today’s defenders of radical Islamic terrorism — progressive leftist Democrats — sound precisely like the attorney’s representing the Islamists in the cases he prosecuted in the 90’s. “As I have previously recounted, when I prosecuted the Blind Sheikh’s terrorist cell in the mid-Nineties, the defense lawyers for the jihadists – who sounded just like today’s anti-anti-terrorist progressives – claimed that their clients had been lured into terrorist activity by U.S. government policy and by the enticements of a government informant who spouted Islam-against-the-world rhetoric. In response to this fatuous contention, we put a very simple question to the jury: “What would it take to turn you into a mass-murderer?” What policy could be so bad, what rhetorical us-against-them flourishes so inspiring, that a person would join the terrorist cause and commit acts of barbarism?” Read more of the article that Twitter doesn’t want you to read HERE.

"So I guess it is back to school for everyone.  I am not really too sure, as the last time I was in a classroom they actually taught curriculum that benefitted students.  I saw an interesting article in Breitbart today which read: “Northwestern President: Critics of Safe Spaces, Trigger Warnings are ‘Lunatics'”.   The article, which appeared in Northwestern University’s student rag newspaper, The Daily Northwestern, was based on a speech given by NU President Morton Schapiro.  I know that listening to libtards is enough to make any of my readers lose their lunch, so I will simply hit the high points.  In his speech Schapiro said: “The people who decry safe spaces do it from their segregated housing places, from their jobs without diversity — they do it from their country clubs. It just drives me nuts.” And about microaggression, what did this academic sainte have to say? “Microaggressions cut you to the core and aren’t easily forgotten…” Ok, first things first: According to his bio, Morton Schapiro has never worked a day in his life outside of academics.  While his resume might sound impressive it has all been in schools and colleges.  This is important because it means that he has nothing in common with the students that will eventually have to graduate his college and, gasp in horror, find a job. Dr. Schapiro told students that ““Look for those safe spaces. If you can’t find them, we will help you find them.”  Alright, call me a sadist, but I would love to be a fly on the wall when one of NU’s students goes into a job interview and starts talking about safe spaces.  Hey buttercup, the real world doesn’t have those!  What are you going to do, little snowflake, when you meet a co-worker or even a boss who says things that you consider “microaggressive”?  Are you going to run to your safe space and hide in your blanket fort whilst sipping a juice box?  Are you going to sit there in a boardroom during a meeting and cry because someone said something that goes against what you believe?  If you can answer yes to both of those questions then you will not be employed for too long.  To survive in the real world you need a level of self discipline and a really, really tough skin.  The working world is tough, it’s a lot tougher when you are a wuss. The whole purpose of college is to prepare its students for the real world not only by teaching them academics that can get them jobs, but also by preparing them for a tough, cold world.  Well, at least that use to be its purpose.  Now the purpose of college is to brainwash and coddle, making spineless wimps out out of the strong and airheads out of the smart.  Today’s colleges are run by administrators and teachers who have never worked a day in the private sector.  They teach theory, not reality.   Students come out with student debts in the hundreds of thousands without the skills necessary to survive in the working world.  I shudder to think that these entitled wusses will someday be running the country.

"Washington (CNN)The Donald Trump-Rosie O'Donnell feud is back in the 2016 spotlight. O'Donnell slammed Trump on Twitter Monday night after he resurrected their longtime feud during the first presidential debate, saying that comments he made about the comedian and TV host in the past — including calling her a ""pig"" — were justified. Declaring her support for Clinton, O'Donnell tweeted, ""HE WILL NEVER BE PRESIDENT"" and then later called on people to ""shame the Donald."" Trump's comments on O'Donnell came after Clinton accused Trump of sexism during the debate, saying, ""This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs."" ""Hillary is hitting me with tremendous commercials. Some of it I said in entertainment, some of it said to somebody who has been very vicious to me, Rosie O'Donnell,"" Trump responded. ""I said very tough things to her and I think everybody would agree she deserves it and nobody feels sorry for her."" The Clinton campaign launched an ad called ""Mirrors"" last week that features young girls looking in the mirror as Trump insults various women. The spot includes comments Trump made about O'Donnell in 2006, calling the former host of ""The View,"" a ""slob"" with a ""fat ugly face,"" and comments Trump made in a 2007 interview with Larry King where called O'Donnell a ""pig."" Trump slammed the ad as ""inappropriate"" and accused Clinton of misrepresenting his views. ""It's inappropriate. It's not nice, but she spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads on me — many of which are absolutely untrue,"" Trump continued. ""They're untrue and they're misrepresentations and I will tell you this, Lester, it's not nice and I don't deserve that."" Trump told Larry King in 2007 that his relationship with O'Donnell prior to their 2006 feud ""was OK,"" but O'Donnell ""was never a friend"" and added that she ""ate like a pig"" while attending his 1993 wedding to now ex-wife, Marla Maples. ""She came to my wedding. She ate like a pig. And — I mean, seriously, the wedding cake was — was — it was like missing in action. I couldn't stand there,"" Trump said. ""I didn't like it, but a particular woman wanted her at the wedding — Marla. I think they were friendly or something. And so I said, 'What's Rosie O'Donnell doing here?'"" Some celebrities came to O'Donnell's defense Monday night. ""Mess with my girl Rosie and you're messing with me!"" Madonna tweeted. Other celebrities, including Lena Dunham, Seth MacFarlane, Leslie Jones and Andy Cohen also chimed in. Trump's feud with O'Donnell first came into the spotlight of the 2016 campaign during the first Republican primary debate in August 2015 when Fox News host Megyn Kelly asked Trump about past comments he made about women, calling them ""fat pigs, dogs, slobs and disgusting animals."" ""Only Rosie O'Donnell,"" Trump quipped before unleashing attacks against Kelly and sparking a months-long feud between the two. ",true
"NEW YORK — Reporters traveling with Hillary Clinton got a taste of the Egyptian security state on Monday — and they didn't much care for it. The Democratic presidential candidate was meeting Monday evening in New York City with Egypt's increasingly authoritarian president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. Story Continued Below According to the press pool report, upon reaching the hotel, the journalists were ordered to leave their bags, phones and computers with campaign staff ""outside of the zone that had been deemed secure."" ""Reporters had to argue with Egyptian security to even carry recorders on their person,"" the pool report states. ""There were also repeated arguments between Clinton campaign staff and the Egyptian security officials about how many reporters could enter the meeting despite having already reached an agreement with the country’s protocol officer prior to our arrival."" Campaign staffers, as well as a Secret Service agent, were with the reporters the entire time. At one point, the journalists got stuck on an elevator with former Undersecretary of State Wendy Sherman, who now advises the Clinton campaign — ""We all got cozy,"" the pool report states. Regardless of who they were with, the reporters went through multiple security sweeps and, at one point, ordered to wait behind a divider. ""Because of our positioning, we were unable to see HRC when she arrived, as previously noted, and without our phones we couldn’t keep track of time,"" the pool report notes. Sisi, a former general, took power in Egypt in 2013 after massive popular protests forced out the elected government of Muslim Brotherhood leader Mohamed Morsi. During his session with Clinton, which lasted more than an hour, Sisi at one point said he wished to talk “about the path that we are taking in order to build up a new civil society, a new modern country that upholds the rule of law, that respects human rights and liberties."" But Sisi is increasingly viewed as a serial human rights violator. Clinton's decision to meet with him signifies the importance the U.S. places on its alliance with Egypt, a relatively stable country in a chaotic Middle East. But she's already drawn criticism from both liberals and conservatives for sitting down with Sisi.",true
"Monday night’s debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will be a battle of facts—and, perhaps more likely, half-facts and flat-out lies. Both candidates, after all, have called out for being exceptionally untrustworthy in a profession that’s not known for its uprightness. At the New Yorker, David Remnick has said of Clinton, “[She] has had her bald-faced moments—moments that are too kindly described as ‘lawyerly,’” while Nicholas Kristof recently wrote, “If deception were a sport, Trump would be the Olympic gold medalist.” When number crunchers are on the case, the candidates don’t fare much better: Politico Magazine recently fact-checked a week’s worth of each candidate’s statements, and found that Trump had uttered one untruth every 3.25 minutes and Clinton, every 12 minutes. In fact, just half of Clinton’s factual assertions have been found to be “true” or “mostly true” by the nonpartisan fact-checkers at Politifact, and Trump’s statements only come in at a pitiful 15 percent. Little wonder that polling shows more than half of likely voters don’t think either candidate is honest, the highest level of distrust in recent elections. Story Continued Below This heightened concern about truthfulness has prompted heated conversations about whether debate moderators should be responsible for live fact-checking. (Clinton says yes, Trump no.) But viewers can prepare themselves regardless: Knowing that we’re in for gale-force fabrications on Monday, how can you steel yourself for the lies ahead? Todd Rogers, an associate professor of public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School, has published two major studies about deception and how audiences respond to it. He has identified five tactics that are mainstays in American politics—and why they often work on us. Here’s a guide to those five types of deception and how they’ve been deployed in recent political history. 1. Artful Dodging What it is: Answering a different question than the one that was asked—not quite a lie, but an evasion. When you’ve seen it: Nearly all political debates feature at least one dodge, also known as a “pivot.” In one Republican primary debate, Trump was asked, “Do you still believe President Bush should have been impeached?”—to which his response started, “First of all, I have to say, as a businessman I get along with everybody. I have business all over the world.” (The rest of his response didn’t answer the question either.) In one of Clinton’s primary debates, she avoided a direct answer about the content of her Goldman Sachs speeches even when pressed. Why it works: Rogers has found that viewers’ limited attention is tied up in deciding whether they like a candidate, not whether the candidate is actually responding to the question. Since many dodges go undetected, candidates don’t often lose points for them. In fact, in the same study, speakers who eloquently answered a similar question were rated as highly as those who inartfully answered the actualquestion. 2. Paltering What it is: Actively using truthful statements to lead a listener to a false conclusion. When you’ve seen it: The best-known political example is probably Bill Clinton’s line during an interview about the Monica Lewinsky scandal: “There is no sexual relationship with that woman,” a sly but truthful use of the present tense to obscure past misdeeds. (Five days later, he upgraded to full-blown lie with “I did not have sexual relations with that woman.”) Trump has also used this tactic when asked about the bankruptcy of Trump Entertainment Resorts: “Seven years ago, I left Atlantic City before it totally cratered, and I made a lot of money in Atlantic City.” The facts are true, but the statement misleadingly recasts a business failure in a positive light. Why it works: Paltering is hard to pick up on, since you’re technically hearing the truth. And Rogers’ research shows that even when outside observers know it’s happening, they consider it more benign than outright lies of commission (see below). 3. Explicit Avoidance What it is: Flat-out refusing to engage with a sticky subject. When you’ve seen it: Politicians use this tactic when they refuse to release their tax returns, like Trump, or medical records, like Hillary Clinton. More often, you see it when politicians or their spokespeople employ the classic “no comment,” or a similar sentiment, as when Bernie Sanders responded to a question about the failures of Venezuela’s socialist model with: “Of course I have an opinion, but as I said, I’m focused on my campaign.” Clinton has done him one better, refusing for much of the campaign to face the press at all (and earning considerable criticism for it). Why it works: Actually, it doesn’t. Rogers’ colleagues have demonstrated that listeners trust and prefer people who reveal to people who hide, even when the information is damaging. 4. Lying by Commission What it is: Saying something you know to be untrue in order to mislead your audience. When you’ve seen it: Politicians most often employ straight-up lies when denying involvement in a scandal. See: Anthony Weiner’s initial denial that he’d sent anyone a close-up photo of his underwear,saying, “This was a prank, a hoax.” Or the response by Congressman Mark Foley’s camp to allegations that he’d sent inappropriate messages to congressional pages: “[This is part of an] an ugly smear campaign.” In this election cycle, Trump has famously clung to the false assertion that he always opposed the Iraq War. Why it works: This tactic can backfire if detected—both Weiner and Foley resigned under pressure, after all. But plenty of political mistruths have remarkable staying power even after being debunked, like claims, long disseminated by Trump, that Barack Obama is a Muslim or was born in Kenya. 5. Lying by Omission What it is: Failing to disclose a piece of relevant information or context, which renders a statement untrue. When you’ve seen it: In promoting the Affordable Care Act, Barack Obama and his team made a number of statements like, “If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan.” This wasn’t strictly true—you could only keep your plan if it hadn’t changed since the ACA was passed. More recently, Trump has trumpeted the virtues of American manufacturing while failing to mention that several Trump products are made overseas. And Clinton’s handling of her private email server could be viewed as one extended lie of omission, since she and her team have provided incomplete information and records on multiple occasions. Why it works: If the public believes something untrue but desirable about a candidate, failure to correct the misperception works in the candidate’s favor. And research has suggested that people prefer tellinglies of omission to lies of commission. Not only is the former therefore more common—it’s also harder to hold people accountable for something they didn’t say than something they did. Still, lies of omission can work against candidates if audiences suspect they’re not being told the whole story. Of course, lies of omission are designed not to de detected—just like other forms of deception. But by studying up on Rogers’ taxonomy of deceit, perhaps debate viewers will better be able to pick up on any misleading tactics the candidates choose to deploy.",true
"Monday evening during the presidential debates, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump doubled down on his plan to reinstate “stop-and-frisk,” using New York City as an example of how effective it was in in eradicating crime. Responding to Lester Holt assertion that “stop and frisk” was ruled unconstitutional, Donald Trump said, “No, you’re wrong. It went before a judge who was a very against police judge. It was taken away from her and our mayor, our new mayor, refused to go forward with the case. They would have won an appeal.” Fact Check: Stop and Frisk is unconstitutional and was neither lawful nor effective. The program, in which police officers arbitrarily decide when to stop and question a pedestrian, then frisk them for weapons and other contraband, was found to be unlawful after evidence provided proved the NYPD engaged in patterns of unconstitutional stops that were more likely to affect African-American and Latino citizens. The program’s defenders claimed high crime rates were the reason behind the disproportionate targeting of minorities, but Jeffrey Fagan at Columbia Law School found after an investigation into the program, that “even if you control for the crime rate, the racial makeup of a precinct is a good predictor of the number of stops” police do in a particular area. “Anyone who says we know this is bringing the crime rate down is really making it up,” Fagan says. Others wouldn’t put it that harshly, but the evidence does seem to suggest that stop and frisk is, at best, ineffective, and, at worst, purposefully targets communities illegally.    Examining the number of police stops per seizures of illicit goods mapped out by race, it becomes blatantly obvious that not only are African-Americans stopped over 5x more than whites, the disproportionate targeting is ineffective in reducing crime further because it ignores that the numbers suggest there would be more illicit good seizures if police attention was concentrated more appropriately in groups with a lower stop-per-seizure. Moreover, as foreign correspondent for NBC News Katy Tur live-tweeted during the debate, the murder rate in New York City did not drop until after stop-and-frisk was declared unconstitutional and stopped, it also has not risen beyond a level of concern.   ",true
"Cities and towns across the nation are fighting Obama’s refugee resettlement efforts to terraform and seed the nation with Islamists. Imperial Beach is a suburb of San Diego and the fighting citizens there want no part of it. Mayor Serge Dedina issued a proclamation declaring Imperial Beach as a Welcoming City. People have pretty much figured out that means Sanctuary City and the Muslims are being forced on their community. He just retracted the proclamation because a) he bypassed the City Council and just did it and b) he pissed off most of the residents there. I don’t blame them for being mad. This fight can be won. The good people of Imperial Beach pushed back and won. All of us should be getting involved and doing the same in our individual communities. It’s a matter of safety, national security and survival. It only took a small, vocal group to make the mayor back down. That’s true patriotism and I’m heartened to see people taking a stand.  From 100PerCentFedUp.com: Last month, Mayor Serge Dedina issued a proclamation, declaring Imperial Beach to be a “Welcoming City.” The “Welcoming Communities” program is an Obama initiative intended to resettle large numbers of refugees from Syria, the rest of the Middle East and Latin America in cities and towns across America as part of his “fundamental transformation.” At the time, Mayor Dedina thought it was pretty harmless, but some people believe it goes deeper than that. They’re suspicious that the words, “welcoming city,” is another way of saying, “sanctuary city.” But Mayor Dedina says that a small town, and a relatively poor town, like Imperial Beach couldn’t handle such a thing, even if they wanted. But that’s not good enough for some skeptics. They want the proclamation erased. The mayor tried to claim the whole thing was a misunderstanding. Sure it was. He knew exactly what he was doing. So now he comes off as a shifty liar as well. Then he tried to dance on the subject and evade questions. Typical sleazy politician. Time to find a new mayor guys. Refugee resettlement is being used to bring into America hundreds of thousands of Islamic refugees and they are being settled in cities without telling the citizens. They bring mosques, Sharia law, disease, intolerance, hatred and crime with them. Combine that with illegal immigrants who are also being shipped all over America and you have the makings of a political coup. Americans must stand up and fight back or we will lose our country and our freedom through these Marxist programs.        ",true
"It’s seven weeks before Election Day, five days before the highly anticipated first debate, and Donald Trump’s television advertisements have all but vanished. Trump’s ads last ran nearly a week ago in four battleground states: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Since then, the GOP presidential nominee has ceded the airwaves to Hillary Clinton — and is only poised to launch a limited, less-targeted ad campaign in the days before next week’s debate. Story Continued Below While his campaign announced a new ad on Tuesday, it’s only going to run on national cable news stations and during two Sunday morning public-affairs shows, according to data from The Tracking Firm, a company that monitors media buys. And even with that seemingly modest buy — the full extent of which wasn't clear on Wednesday night — Clinton is still outspending him this week many times over. “It’s unprecedented for a major-party nominee in this century to have such an on-again, off-again TV buy,” said Elizabeth Wilner, a former TV-network political director who, until last month, monitored political advertising for Kantar Media/CMAG. The strategy has perplexed political media buyers who aren’t affiliated with the campaign. Trump’s campaign is underfunded compared to Hillary Clinton’s — his campaign had only $50 million on hand as of Aug. 30, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission Tuesday night — but Trump’s failure to advertise consistently threatens the efficacy of his entire paid media campaign, limited as it is. The political media buyers, including Republicans who declined to be named in criticizing the nominee, warned that the effects of television ads are fleeting, and any benefit Trump might get from putting his paid advertisements in front of voters can be undone with time if those messages aren’t reinforced. The GOP nominee’s absence is also compounding Clinton’s domination of the airwaves. Last week, Smart Media Group, a media buying firm that works with the Republican National Committee, wrote in a memo to the Trump campaign that through Sept. 12, Trump had spent just $17 million on TV ads, compared to $126 million for Clinton. If outside group spending is counted, the disparity is even more stunning: $244 million for Clinton versus $33 million for Trump. The highly unusual decision to go mostly dark in advance of the debate is emblematic of Trump’s approach to television advertising in the general election, a patchwork effort that has engaged in swing states only in fits and starts. Of the 20 days thus far in September, Trump has advertised in Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania for 11 days, and for 12 in Ohio. He’s also run one-week flights in a number of other states beginning over Labor Day weekend, only to let those expire more than a week ago and decline to rebook. A Trump campaign spokesman declined to reply to inquiries on Tuesday and Wednesday about the campaign’s strategy. Clinton, meanwhile, is continuing to blanket eight states in ads. Confusion about Trump’s strategy runs beyond the scale of his advertising — it’s the unpredictable nature of where and when he is advertising. When Trump first launched his TV ads in mid-August, they were focused on four core states: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Together, those states will award 82 electoral votes — and Trump will win the election if he carries those four and holds all the other states Mitt Romney won in 2012. Trump went on the air in those states on August 19, and he kept advertising in them through September 6 or 7, depending on the state. While those ads were on the air, Trump expanded to six new states: Colorado, Iowa, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire and Virginia. Ads began in those states in early September and ran for roughly one week – including an eye-popping, $2.2-million buy in Virginia, where the Clinton campaign stopped advertising last month after pulling comfortably ahead in the polls. But the Trump ads ended between September 7 and September 10, depending on the state. Trump has been off the air in those places ever since. Meanwhile, he reengaged in his four core states — Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania — on September 12. (Both campaigns abstained from airing ads on the 15th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks.) After nearly a week off the air in those four states most central to his candidacy, Trump last Monday rolled out a combined $2.5-million ad buy over five days. But those reservations ended last Friday. In their place, Trump’s campaign is planning a limited ad campaign, buying time on four cable stations: Fox Business Network, Fox News Channel, MSNBC and CNBC. He’s also planning to run national ads during at least two of the national Sunday morning public affairs programs on broadcast TV: “Fox News Sunday” and NBC’s “Meet the Press.” For political purposes, it’s a relatively inefficient buy. The 11 states that make up POLITICO's Battleground States project hold roughly 29 percent of the population. That means, roughly speaking, that seven-in-10 Americans reached by a national ad buy live outside the battleground states. The Clinton campaign, on the other hand, continues to advertise heavily in eight targeted states: Arizona, Florida, Iowa, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania, while also, at times, running national advertisements. (The campaign’s investments in Arizona, which has voted Republican in 15 of the last 16 presidential elections, are much smaller than in the other states.) Just this week — from Tuesday through next Monday, the day of the first debate — Clinton is poised to spend nearly $6.8 million on TV ads, backed up by another $5.6 million from pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action in those states, minus Arizona. Trump’s air cover from outside groups is also far more limited than Clinton’s. Rebuilding America Now, a pro-Trump super PAC, is spending $635,000 in Pennsylvania this week. And an anti-Clinton super PAC based in Wisconsin, Reform America Fund, is spending $332,000 in that state, where neither campaign has advertised thus far. There are some signs Trump’s campaign may be focusing on its seemingly haphazard ad efforts. GOP ad-maker Rex Elsass met with Trump campaign officials last week, POLITICO reported on Tuesday. The campaign has already reserved about $2.8 million in satellite TV ads slated to air beginning on Tuesday, Sept. 27, through the day before Election Day in eight states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. For Trump, there’s risk in continuing to delay: Booking ads at the last minute, as Trump’s campaign has been doing, sometimes means spending more money for the same spot as a campaign that makes its reservations earlier. And there are some signs that some of the late decision-making is driven by the candidate: The New York Times reported earlier this month that Trump himself has been selecting the media markets in which the campaign has been advertising. Since research suggests the effects of television ads are short-lived — and with the race tightening in the battleground states in recent weeks, Trump can ill-afford to regress. “It has to be consistent,” said one GOP ad-buyer, “because the recall on these just evaporates when you go dark.” Alex Isenstadt contributed to this report.",true
"One of the biggest problems in arming the so-called “moderate” Syrian rebels to fight ISIS is that we truly don’t know who the moderates are. Just think of post cases where we’ve armed insurgents, such as the Mujahideen during the Cold War to fight the Russians – only to have many of them later morph into Al-Qaeda and The Taliban.  The same is true of the so-called moderates in Syria. A video went viral last month of one such “moderate” group of rebels beheading a 12 year old boy, which I won’t link to for obvious reasons – and how many other groups have members who would do the same? Most of the dozens of groups fighting in the Syrian Civil War have some sort of ideological motivation, and even “moderate” Muslims could change their tune when they have the power to influence government. It’s too late now though, as the House voted to arm Syrian rebels back in 2014, and John McCain was a huge proponent of it. And how is that working out? Let’s take a peak… As WeaselZippers reported: Video footage appears to show US commandos fleeing a Syrian town under a barrage of abuse and insults hurled at them by fighters from the American-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebel group. The video appears to be the first evidence of US special forces cooperating with Turkish troops in their battle against Islamic State (Isil). The incident illustrates the complex web of alliances and enmities in Syria, where many of America’s allies are fighting each other and some rebel groups that receive US support still harbour strong anti-American sentiments. The footage shows a crowd of rebel fighters in the town of al-Rai near the Turkish border, which was captured from Isil by Syrian rebel groups with the backing of Turkey. Turkey, which launched a military incursion into Syria in late August, has been backing the FSA. The fighters scream anti-American chants as a column of pick-up trucks carrying US commandos drives away from them. “Christians and Americans have no place among us,” shouts one man in the video. “They want to wage a crusader war to occupy Syria.” Another man calls out: “The collaborators of America are dogs and pigs. They wage a crusader war against Syria and Islam. ” The US troops are not wearing traditional uniform but they carry American weapons and are wearing the distinctive round helmets favoured by US special forces. Two days ago, the U.S. admitted that we may have possibly accidentally bombed Syrian forces in an airstrike that was meant for ISIS. However, when Syrian forces (who are supposed to be our allies) are threatening us, could that strike have been intentional, and we just claimed it was meant for ISIS as cover up? Just when you thought the Syrian Civil War couldn’t get even more complicated, it did. ",fake
"President Barack Obama hailed the timing of the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture on Friday, signaling his desire for people of all stripes to visit the new museum and walk away with a better understanding of what it’s like to be black in America. “The timing of this is fascinating,” Obama said during a reception at the White House. The “exceptionally good-looking group” of many friends — so many “that it feels like one of our house parties,” he quipped — applauded in agreement. Story Continued Below “Part of the reason that I am so happy the museum is opening this weekend is because it allows all of us as Americans to put our current circumstances in a historical context,” Obama said. “My hope is that as people are seeing what’s happened in Tulsa or Charlotte on television, and perhaps are less familiar with not only the history of the African-American experience but also how recent some of these challenges have been, upon visiting the museum may step back and say: ‘I understand. I sympathize. I empathize. I can see why folks might feel angry, and I wanna be part of the solution, as opposed to resisting change.’” Obama’s references to Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina, highlight the most recent officer-involved shootings of black men that have captured the nation’s attention. Officers fatally shot Terence Crutcher, who was unarmed and had his hands raised when he was struck, in Tulsa last Friday and Keith Lamont Scott, who officers contend was armed when he was struck but concede that video doesn’t conclusively corroborate their account, in Charlotte on Tuesday. Obama, flanked by first lady Michelle Obama and the museum’s director, Lonnie Bunch, used a sampling of letters he said he read on Thursday to illustrate the divide among Americans when it comes to policing and talks of racial bias. “I’d say about half of them said, ‘Mr. President, why are you always against police, and why aren’t you doing enough to deal with these rioters and the violence?’” he said. “And then the other half were some black folks [who] said, ‘Mr. President, why aren’t you doing something about the police, and when are we actually gonna get justice?’ And I understand the nature of that argument because this is a dialogue we’ve been having for 400 years.” A key challenge Obama cited in “generating a constructive discussion about how to solve these problems” is rhetoric on TV and the radio that’s “bereft of context and ignores history.” “So people are just responding as if none of what’s represented in this museum ever happened,” Obama said, “adding, “That’s true for all of us, not just some of us.” “My hope is, is that this, this complicated, difficult, sometimes harrowing but I believe ultimately triumphant story, will help us talk to each other,” he continued. “And more important, listen to each other. And even more important, see each other, and recognize the common humanity that makes America what it is.”",true
"Its prospects are far from clear, but talk about the impeachment of Gov. Chris Christie is no longer relegated to whispers between insiders. The prosecution’s opening argument in the Bridgegate case — which featured the claim that Christie was told of the George Washington Bridge lane closures as they happened by two high ranking Port Authority of New York and New Jersey appointees — brought the talk into the open. Story Continued Below Now Democratic lawmakers who control the Assembly and state Senate are watching the trial carefully to see if any more revelations could warrant the attempted removal of the governor from office. “All we know are the coming attractions that were given to us by each of the attorneys during their opening statements. They’ve all told us there will be proof at the trial that he governor knew about this,” said Assemblyman John Wisniewski, who helped break the controversy open as the leader of a committee investigating the Fort Lee bridge access lane closures that tied up traffic for days. “We don’t know exactly what that proof is,” Wisniewski said. “For instance, is it merely the photograph of the three of them talking before 9/11? That’s something we’ve already known about and in my opinion it’s hard to make a strong case for the photo alone that the governor knew.” A Democratic assemblyman who refused to discuss impeachment publicly confirmed a Friday morning NBC New York report that legislative staffers have begun researching the impeachment process. No governor in the state has been impeached before. The process would have to start in the Assembly. Earlier this week, the liberal group NJ Working Families called for Christie’s impeachment. Assembly Speaker Vincent Prieto, who would make the call to begin the proceedings, said through a spokesman he “won't be commenting on the trial until it's completed and all evidence has been presented.” Still, even if the Assembly votes by a simple majority to initiate impeachment, it would then have to be tried in the Senate. Removing Christie from office would require a two-thirds majority there, which Democrats don’t have on their own. That could be complicated by the fact that Senate President Stephen Sweeney, under the state constitution, would not be allowed to participate in the trial — a vestige of New Jersey’s pre-lieutenant governor system when the Senate president was next in line for the governorship. Montclair State political science professor Brigid Harrison, who recently penned an op-ed that upped the intensity of impeachment talk, said that her interpretation of the constitution is that the Senate president would still be able to vote, though it might require some legal interpretation. The constitution states that the Senate trial would be presided over by the chief justice of the state Supreme Court and that “the President of the Senate shall not participate in the trial.” If Sweeney could not vote and the remaining 23 Senate Democrats were in lock step in favor of impeachment, at least four Republicans would have to join them to successfully remove Christie from office. Barring damning new evidence, it’s hard to see Senate Republicans going that way. The governor has had tremendous sway over the votes of GOP lawmakers. Only once have enough Senate Republicans joined Democrats to vote to override Christie’s veto of a piece of legislation, despite dozens of attempts. State Senate Republican Leader Tom Kean Jr. did not return a call seeking comment. It's also far from certain that Senate Democrats would vote in lock step to remove Christie from office. South Jersey Democratic power broker George Norcross, a close ally of Gov. Chris Christie, is the political benefactor for several of them, including Sweeney. Other Democratic senators have been staunch Christie allies, and one, Sandra Cunningham, is a personal friend. And Christie is close with Essex County Executive Joseph DiVincenzo, whose deputy chief of staff is Democratic state Sen. Teresa Ruiz. Democrats would also be creating a political obstacle for themselves through impeachment. Christie’s popularity is mired at 26 percent, making him one of the least popular governors in the nation. He’s so disliked in New Jersey that Democrats are considered near shoo-ins to win the governorship in 2017. Handing the governor’s office to Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, who is already laying the groundwork for a run in 2017, would not only give her the power of incumbency, but a potential easy way to make a fresh start while distancing herself from Christie. “It’s easier to run against Christie’s legacy than it would be to run against Guadagno,” Harrison said. Monmouth University pollster Patrick Murray said Wisniewski, who's considering a run for governor, may benefit from impeachment. But it's far from certain other hopefuls, like Sweeney, would welcome it. ""There’s too many gubernatorial wannabees that don’t want to deal with an impeachment and, two, an incumbent Kim Guadgano as their opponent,"" Murray said. “The politics of it — there are too many people who have more to lose from that spectacle for a variety of reasons.""",true
"Washington (CNN)Sen. Joe Manchin strongly defended his daughter, Heather Bresch, over growing criticism that her company dramatically raised prices for its life-saving medicine in order to enrich her company -- and herself. In an exclusive interview with CNN, the West Virginia Democrat broke his silence and sharply criticized lawmakers from both parties who have seized on the rising cost of EpiPen to bash his daughter's stewardship of her company, Mylan. He said lawmakers were trying to be ""sensational"" by seizing on Bresch's multi-million-dollar compensation. And he slammed an article in USA Today for questioning whether his wife, Gayle, improperly used her position in an education group to boost the drug's prices, calling it a ""cheap shot"" and ""tabloid"" journalism. He praised Mylan as a West Virginia company that saved the country $180 billion. Bresch became a target of derision over the summer after a nearly 500% increase in the cost of the lifesaving allergy drug EpiPen, which is one of the company's signature products. The drug, which cost around $100 in 2009, shot up to as much as $600. The move sparked outrage from parents with children who rely on the drug, and even prompted comments from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on the need to rein in rising drug costs. One of those parents was actually a colleague of Manchin -- Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar -- and multiple members of Congress called for hearings on the spiking cost. Above all else, Manchin said it was unfair to blame Mylan for the dramatic increase in EpiPen, saying it was a problem in a ""convoluted"" system and middlemen that helped raise the price. ""Heather is the most caring, sharing, generous person I've ever met in my entire life - most accomplished and tougher than nails,"" he said. ""Absolutely,"" Manchin said when asked if his daughter was forthright to House lawmakers during a contentious hearing Wednesday. ""But people have to listen, too."" He added: ""We can criticize and beat the living crap out of anyone we want to, and that was proven yesterday. But does that solve the problem? Do they really want to solve the problem?"" Bresch earned nearly $19 million last year. Manchin suggested that the attacks on his daughter's compensation, which he called ""pretty sensational,"" were to be expected given her success. ""You have to expect that, you know,"" he said. ""I make $174,000. They haven't attacked me yet, but I'm sure that people who make less than 174 would attack us, too."" Asked if his daughter performed well, Manchin said that while anyone can always improve, she succeeded given the circumstances. ""That's a hostile environment,"" he said. ""Do they really want to fix a problem or do they want to make a statement for the next campaign?"" CNN's David Wright contributed reporting.",true
"(CNN)Michelle Obama on Tuesday joked about the plagiarism controversy that engulfed Melania Trump during the Republican National Convention, delivering a dry retort when ""The Late Show"" host Stephen Colbert asked the first lady if she was sympathetic to the plight of a fellow political spouse. ""Melania Trump was criticized for using what turned out to be a portion of your speech -- but do you have any sympathy? Because there are people around her creating things, and you know, I have sympathy for her. Do you understand how that might be sympathetic, for what happened to her?"" the CBS host asked. ""Yeah, that was tough,"" Obama deadpanned, prompting laughs from the audience. Colbert also asked the first lady if she was sympathetic to political spouses who are required to stand behind partners whose political beliefs are antithetical to their own -- a premise Obama flatly rejected. ""Do you have any sympathy for the people who have to go there and stand by the person running for president?"" ""No,"" Obama replied. ""Because if -- you know, you have to be, you know, in it. If you're in it, and if you don't agree, you should have agreed before they ran. Bottom line is, if you didn't agree with what Barack was saying, I would not support his run. So I stand there proudly, and I hope they are, too, standing with their spouses proudly. So no, no sympathy."" During her appearance on the show, Obama also joked around with Colbert, climbing into a blanket fort with the host (a recurring segment on the show) to discuss serious issues, like investment in education for young girls around the world, and less serious ones -- such as when a conversation about healthy eating turned into a joke about how eating too many carrots can turn someone orange. ""And if you turn really orange, you have to start saying crazy things and run for president,"" Colbert cracked. ",true
"Donald Trump, in hot water over a report that his charity used donations to cover business-related legal fees, told a campaign rally crowd on Tuesday that “there’s nothing like doing things with other people’s money.” The comment about “other people’s money” came during a campaign rally in North Carolina, where Trump pledged to keep refugees from the Middle East out of the U.S. and instead put them in “safe zones” that would be built with money from Gulf nations. It is a financial maneuver the real estate mogul said he has performed many times throughout his career. Story Continued Below “It’s called OPM. I do that all the time in business. It’s called other people’s money. There’s nothing like doing things with other people’s money,” Trump said. “Because it takes, the risk, you get a good chunk of it and it takes the risk. We’re going to do this, in this case, from a humanitarian standpoint. OPM: other people’s money.” Under a Trump administration, the Gulf states would not be the only foreign countries on the hook to pay for the Manhattan billionaire’s proposals. From the very beginning of his campaign, Trump has pledged to build a wall along America’s southern border and force Mexico to pay for it. During Trump’s visit to Mexico last month, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto said his nation would not pay for the wall. Trump said the subject of who would pay was not discussed during their meeting. The former reality TV star made his promise to use “other people’s money” on the same day The Washington Post published a story accusing Trump of spending $258,000 from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits involving his other businesses.",true
"There’s nothing wrong with protesting a perceived injustice. One of our most cherished American rights is the right to peacefully assemble — to protest. However, that’s often not what happens when Black Lives Matter activists set out to make a statement. Too often, they don’t understand what the words “peaceful protest” mean. That was proved true once again in North Carolina last night, when a Black Lives Matter mob descended upon a highway and began attacking people. The rioters began by throwing rocks at cars and trucks, protesting the shooting of a black man on that same highway.

Message to these Black Lives Matter protesters: this doesn’t help your cause. Protesting the killing of a black man at the hands of police is a valid thing to do. Shutting down a freeway, throwing rocks at cars, attacking an innocent truck driver and injuring 16 police officers is not. That’s not a protest; it’s a riot. And it doesn’t endear anyone to the Black Lives Matter cause. It makes racial division worse and inflames racial tension. That doesn’t fix anything. Martin Luther King, Jr. encouraged people to use love, hope and integrity to make a difference when he was fighting for civil rights. It’s shameful to see the Black Lives Matter movement literally doing the exact opposite. Instead of love, they spread anger and hatred and intolerance. They encourage black people to see themselves as perpetual victims and white people as racist oppressors. How they are able to look at themselves in the mirror without feeling deep shame for their actions is truly beyond comprehension. ",true
"New York (CNN)President Barack Obama confronted one of his most strained foreign partnerships Wednesday during a final meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the pair making a last attempt at patching up their stormy bond before Obama leaves office. Speaking before their session, Obama said he was aiming to ascertain the prospects for peace in the region as he prepares to end his presidency. ""Our hope will be that in these conversations we get the sense of how Israel sees the next few years, what the opportunities are and what the challenges are in order to ensure we keep alive the possibility of a stable, secure Israel at peace with its neighbors,"" Obama said. ""These are challenging times. One thing that I would say about Prime Minister Netanyahu is that he is always very candid with us."" That candor has become a hallmark of the relationship between Obama and his Israeli counterpart, whom the White House has accused of being less-than-diplomatic in expressing his opposition to US policies like the nuclear agreement with Iran. Obama's 30-minute meeting Wednesday with Netanyahu was likely to be their final opportunity for face-to-face consultations before a new president enters the Oval Office in January. Obama is intent on conferring solid ties with Israel upon his successor, despite the personal animus that developed between him and Netanyahu, as he looks to boost the relationship during the homestretch of a presidential campaign in which he hopes to see Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton prevail. Obama took a step toward solidifying the alliance this month by completing a long-term, $38 billion security aid package for Israel, the largest such agreement ever for a US ally. The aid, Obama said, ""allows the kind of certainty in a moment where there's enormous uncertainty in the region. It is a very difficult and dangerous time in the Middle East and we want to make sure Israel has full capabilities to keep the Israeli people safe."" In their talks, Obama said he and his Israeli counterpart would discuss challenges in Syria, and said he would get Netanyahu's assessment of conditions in Israel and the West Bank. ""Clearly there is great danger of not just terrorism but also flare-ups of violence,"" he said. ""We do have concerns about settlement activity as well."" Obama hopes to take steps in his final days in office to promote renewed talks between the Israelis and the Palestinians on peace, though his previous efforts toward reconciliation in the region have fallen short. ""My hope is we can continue to be an effective partner in Israel in finding a path to peace,"" Obama said. But the White House remains opposed to Israel's expanded settlement activity in the West Bank, and has expressed disappointment at Netanyahu's occasional skepticism about the viability of a two-state solution in the region. In the meeting Wednesday Obama raised ""profound US concerns about the corrosive effect that that is having on the prospects of two states."" ""They've never papered over their differences,"" another senior administration official said of Obama and Netanyahu. In his final United Nations address Tuesday, Obama made scant reference to the Israel-Palestine conflict, saying only that ""Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel, but Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land."" The passing remark was in stark comparison to the large amounts of time Obama spent on the issue during addresses to the UN earlier in his tenure. The shift reflected the now-frozen peace negotiations, which moved in spurts during Obama's presidency but never materialized into a workable solution. The White House has conceded that talks aren't likely to resume while Obama remains in office but has remained open to the possibility the President could take steps in the next months to ramp up pressure on both sides to work toward a two-state solution. ""With respect to Middle East peace, I wouldn't rule out the President taking any particular step on the issue,"" Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national security adviser, said Tuesday. ""What I would say is his test has always been, can I make a positive difference by engaging on the Israeli-Palestinian issue? We've tried multiple tactics, none of them have succeeded, given the fact that the parties themselves have been unable to come together."" Obama's talks with Netanyahu Wednesday capped a tumultuous personal history, though both displayed a businesslike camaraderie during their photo-op. The low point between the two men came in March 2015, when Netanyahu infuriated the White House by publicly lobbying against the Iran nuclear deal before Congress -- a move the administration lambasted as a breach of diplomatic protocol. Netanyahu returned to Washington last November in an attempt to repair the relationship, meeting with Obama in the Oval Office and addressing both the conservative American Enterprise Institute and the left-leaning Center for American Progress, the think tank with ties to Clinton. Netanyahu on Wednesday invited Obama for a round of golf in Israel once he departs office in January, saying warmly that Obama's ""influential voice"" on international politics would remain a force ""for many decades."" ""Our alliance has grown decade after decade, through successive presidents, bipartisan Congresses and with the overwhelming support of the American people,"" he said. ""It is an unbreakable bond.""

She's in this for the right reasons,"" Obama told ABC News. ""I think there's a reason why we haven't had a woman president before, and so she's having to break down some barriers. There's a level of mistrust and a caricature of her that just doesn't jibe with who I know.""

Cadets vote at a polling station. Vladimir Putin's United Russia party won a greater share of the vote than in 2011, with even less space in parliament for any real opposition party | Vasily Batanov/AFP via Getty Images By Oliver Carroll 9/19/16, 3:14 PM CET Updated 9/20/16, 6:08 AM CET MOSCOW — Two years of economic recession, Western sanctions and wars in Ukraine and Syria haven’t shaken Vladimir Putin’s grip on power. Instead, Sunday’s election to the Russian state Duma saw the president’s United Russia party win a greater share of the vote than in 2011, with even less space in parliament for any real opposition party. There was never any doubt about the outcome, and many Russians didn’t bother to turn out. Nationwide, only 48 percent voted compared to 60 percent in the previous elections for the lower house of parliament. The numbers were even worse in Moscow and St. Petersburg, bastions of the educated middle classes and traditionally more protest-oriented. This time, despite some reports of voter fraud, there were no signs of demonstrations. “They did everything [so] that people would ignore the elections, from holding them just after the summer break, to the most low-key election campaign I can remember,” said political expert Grigorii Golosov. On Monday, with 93 percent of the votes counted, United Russia had 54.2 percent of the vote, up from 49.3 percent five years ago. Russia’s new electoral system, a mix of party lists and single mandate districts, means that Putin’s party wins a huge constitutional majority of 343 seats in the 450-seat Duma — compared to 238 seats in 2011. With its super majority, United Russia will have free rein over parliament, dropping the need to bargain with friendly opposition parties. It can also change the constitution at will. In southern Russia a CCTV camera caught a polling official stuffing a ballot box. On the latest figures, the Communist Party will likely finish second, slightly ahead of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia, with the center-left Just Russia fourth. They were all in the previous parliament, and traditionally support the government on many issues and refrain from attacking Putin. While there is some pressure for the Communists to be more independent— their leader Gennady Zyuganov at one point refused to recognize the results — all three can be expected to remain loyal. All in all, it was a terrible election for Russia’s liberal fringe, which now faces the prospect of obliteration. They’re down from one seat in the previous Duma to none. Their best hope, the liberal opposition Yabloko party, scored less than 2 percent of the vote, and will now lose out on government funding. The liberal-democratic PARNAS party failed to get 1 percent, and most of the candidates supported by exiled oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky were wiped out. Also On Politico Oliver Carroll Also On Politico Kristen East Also On Politico Vince Chadwick The centrist opposition also failed to break through in any of the single-mandate districts. The closest candidate, Yabloko’s Dmitry Gudkov, lost in the Moscow suburbs. As he faced defeat, Gudkov told POLITICO he had battled the full might of the government machine, but said that the result was ultimately down to the passivity of Russian democrats. “Voters didn’t turn up,” he said. “Russia’s middle class now is about to get what it deserves.” Only one independent and two right-wing populist candidates made it into the Duma, but they won’t give much support to the liberal opposition. One of the nationalist winners of the single-mandate run-offs was Vitaly Milonov, a former deputy of the St. Petersburg city government who has campaigned on an anti-gay rights platform. Although the outcome was never in doubt, the Kremlin made sure that the voting procedure was cleaned up from 2011, when voter fraud sparked anti-Putin protests. However, there were still questionable incidents, the most obvious being in Rostov in southern Russia where a CCTV camera caught a polling official stuffing a ballot box. In other places, voters were lured to the polls with free sausages and other goodies. Denis Korotkov, a correspondent for the St. Petersburg news portal Fontanka, managed to vote several times. He immediately wrote about the incident and brought it to the attention of the authorities. Law enforcement subsequently detained Korotkov — who is now threatened with prosecution for electoral violations. While the opposition faces being wiped out, the upshot for Putin is that his control of Russia is stronger than ever. He is likely to decide to run for a fourth term as president in 2018. As part of the preparations for yet another run, Putin recently reshuffled his closest advisers, weeding out those who might dare to challenge him and replacing them with lesser-known men completely dependent on his favor. The election also means there is likely to be little change in Russia’s policies on Ukraine and Syria, or in its economic program. “In practical terms, little will change with the new parliament,” wrote Capital Economics, an analysis firm, in a post-election note. “United Russia already held a majority in parliament, and didn’t face effective opposition. The strong showing for United Russia (and disappointing results for the opposition) suggests that the direction of policy will be largely unchanged.”  © 2016 POLITICO SPRL Log in to access content and manage your profile.

"I think what’s most likely is that the audience just thought the candidate was being funny. I mean, isn’t it a joke to say that anyone in the Clinton family is honest? Even if it weren’t a joke, the congressional candidate on the Democratic ticket had to have known that his comment would have elicited laughter from the audience. He made his comments during a debate with incumbent representative David Jolly. Former Florida Governor Charlie Crist is vying for Rep. Jolly’s spot in the state’s 13th congressional district. The moderator had asked Crist if he was planning on voting for his party’s nominee. Here’s how he answered: “I am proud of Hillary Clinton. I think she’s been a very good secretary of state, a very good senator from the state of New York. The thing I like most about her is I believe she is steady. I believe that she is strong. I believe that she is honest. And I look forward to voting for her.” “Honest” and “steady,” huh? That had to have been a joke. I don’t know exactly what he meant by “steady,” but that’s an interesting way to describe Hillary, especially in the midst of her health crisis. Why would he refer to her as being steady? She would have collapsed at that 9/11 memorial event if it weren’t for her security detail breaking her fall and carrying her into the van. The crowd reacted appropriately as one does when a comedian pokes fun at a politician.  Even Democrats understand Hillary’s aversion to honesty. A staggering 64% of voters – and that’s including Democrats – believe that their candidate is not honest or trustworthy, according to a recent Fox News poll. Of course, it probably won’t stop them from voting for her just the same.    The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.",true
"This is just beautiful. This is the way it should be. No government involvement, no forcing people to do things they don’t want to do, just the people using their views to give their opinions on the NFL National Anthem controversy. I’m not a big sports fan, but I know several people who are. They bleed their team colors and are a little too serious about winning. They would travel across the country to see their team play and they have cut their ties with the NFL. Their hardcore devotion to their team is not enough to get them past the fact that they don’t want to see the country they love disrespected by people who have done nothing but gain from our freedom. SANTA CLARA, CA – SEPTEMBER 12: Colin Kaepernick #7 of the San Francisco 49ers kneels in protest during the National Anthem prior to playing the Los Angeles Rams in their NFL game at Levi’s Stadium on September 12th, 2016 in Santa Clara, California. (Photo by Robert Reiners/Getty Images) James Olson is not alone, but he is a perfect example of what millions of Americans are feeling right now. James Olson, a Sports Illustrated subscriber since fourth grade, watches action-packed NFL games on TV to escape from the endless round of political bickering playing out on other channels. But with more national anthem protests cropping up, he feels like politics has taken over his favorite sport, too. So he’s tuning out. “I want to say to these guys ‘If you weren’t playing in the NFL, you would be working at McDonalds. I think people have had it,” said, Olson, a Birmingham, Mich., resident. People don’t watch sports for half-baked political statements, they watch because they like to see their favorite player score, giving them bragging rights until the next game. If they wanted politics, they’d turn on the news. What happens when a beloved sport like football becomes entwined with something as deeply divisive as politics? Well according to Forbes, the first official game of the season brought in 13% fewer viewers than last year. This, they said, is the lowest number of live viewers in the last seven years. So, now I pose a question to you; should Americans turn off the TV when football comes on? Should we choose to support our nation over our favorite team and more importantly, do you actually think it will yield the desired results? Let us know your thoughts on our Facebook page! ",fake
"Please disable your Ad Blocker in order to interact with the site. The Media (D) loves to tell the unarmed black man shot by cop story. The problem is, this isn’t that story. The riot in Charlotte was huge and escalated quickly. You know how Keith Lamont Scott’s family has been saying he had no gun and he was holding a book? That was a lie. Watch the News Report: Now watch the Charlotte Police Chief, Kerr Putney: …the media caused all this. More than 1,000 people heard on the news that a guy holding a book was shot by police, and even though these people didn’t know the guy who was shot, they came out anyway and rioted. And yet none of what they heard was true. A man with a gun was told by police to drop his gun, and he did not comply with that request. I hate to tell you this, but that is going to get you shot every time. Not only that, but in this case – contrary to the media’s racist-white-cops narrative, it was a black cop who felt threatened and fired his weapon, and a black police chief who backed up what his officers had to do. Do #BlackCopLivesMatter? …The media’s recklessness unleashed mayhem in Charlotte, for no reason whatsoever. And these malevolent fools will pay no price for what they’ve done.

"We are heading into yet another day of unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, and one GOP congressman is blaming the victims of systemic racism that lead to the deaths of so many black people at the hands of those sworn to serve and protect in the most blatantly racist way yet. North Carolina GOP Congressman Robert Pittenger had some extraordinary opinions to express here, but he swears he is not racist. Pittenger said that the protesters: âThe grievance in their minds, the animus, the anger. They hate white people because white people are successful and theyâre not.â Yes, he actually said that.

He insisted that he is simply upset, thatÂ âwhat is taking place in my hometown right now breaks my heart.â He also said,Â âMy anguish led me to respond to a reporterâs question in a way that I regret.â Pittenger, a die-hard Trumpkin, insists that he isnât racist eh?

"Massive protests have broken out in Charlotte, North Carolina, after police shot and killed disabled African-American man named Keith Lamont Scott, who was apparently reading a book in his car, waiting for his son to come home from school when officers shot him dead. Details are still sketchy at the moment, but it appears the police were in search of of another armed man in the area. Scott is the sixth civilian shot by Charlotte police this year. Twelve officers have apparently been injured as tear gas canisters were fired into the crowd. Coming so soon after the shooting of Terrence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma, it is clear that all the protests and anger at the disregard for the lives of black Americans shown by our police forces have accomplished nothing. Scott is the 215th black man shot by police this year. This is an ongoing story that will be updated as new developments occur.

"Washington (CNN)Kix Brooks, one half of the country music duo Brooks and Dunn, is not buying the gloom and doom expressed on the campaign trail about America's declining greatness -- often espoused by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" Dierks Bentley on Donald Trump and the country music vote ""We've always been great, as far as I'm concerned,"" the country music artist, whose classic 2001 hit ""Only America"" with Ronnie Dunn became an anthem for patriotism following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, told CNN. ""There's a lot of stuff that we can do better and there's a lot of stuff that we do better than anybody in the world, but that's life. That's our project as Americans -- we always work to be better,"" he continued. But Brooks, who considers himself to be ""fairly conservative,"" is not optimistic that the next commander-in-chief will be able to make good on his or her promises to solve some of the country's most divisive issues if Washington remains gridlocked and the US continues to be as ""polarized"" as it is today. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has promised to work with Congress to implement comprehensive immigration reform and pledged to take on the gun lobby to institute ""common sense"" gun-control measures. Meanwhile, Trump has promised to build a wall on the southern border between the US and Mexico. CHECK OUT: #GetPolitical — A CNN Politics original series ""I think all the issues that are on the table, from gun control to immigration, are so complicated, there is no easy answer,"" Brooks told CNN. ""None of these problems are going to be solved overnight or probably in the next four years no matter what either candidate says."" On gun culture Lamenting the hostility that has often plagued the gun-control debate on both sides, the ""Boot Scootin' Boogie"" artist said that the right to bear arms is an American principle that ""should be respected."" ""We do have a Second Amendment and it's something that should be respected and discussed in a civilized way,"" Brooks said. ""My only concerns are that Second Amendment rights are discussed with so much ferocity that sometimes we don't hear what each other is saying."" Brooks, who is an avid hunter, grew up in Shreveport, Louisiana, along the Red River, and as he toured the country to play music over the last two decades, he witnessed a stark cultural divide between rural and urban America when it comes to guns. While Americans in rural America ""never considered what a gang was,"" Brooks said, those in urban America also don't understand that ""having a shotgun in the back of your pick up truck was also just a way of life"" for Americans like him. Brooks is a strong supporter of states' rights and said that gun-control solutions to address gang violence and gun violence in American cities are not necessarily needed or effective in rural America. ""I don't feel like what's good for California is good for Tennessee, is good for Louisiana, is good for New York City,"" Brooks said,"" adding, that local ""leaders in our own communities know much better what our problems are and how we should deal with them than Washington, D.C., does."" And as for election 2016, Brooks did not say who he is voting for but said if he hears a candidate speaking along those lines, he tends ""to listen more closely."" On 'Only in America' Many artists have protested when politicians with views they oppose use their songs during campaign events. However, when then-Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama played Brooks and Dunn's ""Only in America"" at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, that was not the case. ""Seems ironic that the same song Bush used at the Republican Convention last election would be used by Obama and the Democrats now,"" Brooks said at the time. ""Very flattering to know our song crossed parties and potentially inspires all Americans."" Brooks, who was a supporter of President George W. Bush, said that he co-wrote ""Only in America"" with his friend and music producer Don Cook -- a Democrat -- after they spent day in the woods, riding four-wheelers near Brooks' farm and talking about how grateful they are to be Americans. ""The song was never meant to be political in any way. It still isn't,"" Brooks said. ""The song is patriotic ... Call it corny or flag-waving or whatever you want to, but I'm really sincere about it. It means a lot to me -- our country does and everything it stands for."" ",true
"(CNN)Congressional Black Caucus members demanded that the Justice Department ""aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions"" regarding the recent deaths of two black men, which stemmed from fatal police shootings. ""We come to you today to urge you to aggressively pursue investigations, indictments and prosecutions through the Office of Civil Rights against any and all law enforcement officers who harm or kill innocent unarmed black men, women and children,"" said Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, reading excerpts from a letter members later presented to Attorney General Loretta Lynch decrying violence. ""We will not continue to ask our constituents to be patient without any hope for change,"" she added. ""Madame Attorney General, you have the unique opportunity and constitutional responsibility to change this narrative."" Caucus Chair G. K. Butterfield said the incidents this week are not isolated. ""The Congressional Black Caucus is outraged with the dozens of unlawful police shootings that are taking place all across America involving unarmed, innocent African-American citizens,"" Butterfield told reporters. ""If we were to identify each of these, it would consume this entire press conference,"" the North Carolina Democrat added. Multiple members of the group, which includes dozens of African-American members of Congress, have spoken out following the death of Terence Crutcher, who was shot and killed last week in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after his car broke down. The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time. ""He posed no threat. He had no weapon. And yet he was confronted by the Tulsa Police Department and he was both tasered and shot to death,"" said New Jersey Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman in a video posted on the caucus' page. ""This is disgusting. And I am angry and I am hurt."" In a news conference Thursday, Lynch expressed sorrow about the ongoing conflicts between law enforcement and people of color. ""One of my top priorities as attorney general has been to do everything in my power to help heal those divides. And the Department of Justice will continue working tirelessly to protect the rights of all Americans,"" she said. ""We have come together with thoughts and prayers far too many times for victims of violence -- civilians and law enforcement alike,"" she added. Multiple police officers and citizens have been injured this week during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by a police officer. Police say Scott was armed at the time he was fatally shot, but his family claims that he was reading a book in his vehicle when police officers approached and shot him. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Chief Kerr Putney said Thursday that the department would not be releasing a video of the encounter between Scott and law enforcement. Rep. Joyce Beatty told CNN's John Berman that lawmakers ""can't be silent."" ""I think transparency is of the utmost. I understand the legalities. I understand that you have to have a full investigation,"" she said on ""At This Hour."" ""We want to make sure that the US Department of Justice is engaged. We want to have independent investigators going into these communities so we take away all doubt or perceptions of the biases,"" the Ohio Democrat said. ""We're losing too many lives."" Both presidential candidates have spoken out this week about the need to improve the relationship between black communities and law enforcement. Hillary Clinton, who the Black Caucus' political action committee endorsed, addressed the shootings in a speech Wednesday in Orlando, Florida. ""There is still much we don't know yet about what happened in both incidents. But we do know that we have two more names to add to a list of African-Americans killed by police officers in these encounters,"" Clinton said. ""It's unbearable. And it needs to become intolerable."" And Donald Trump said Wednesday he was ""very troubled"" by the fatal police shooting in Tulsa and suggested the officer in question ""got scared"" or was ""choking,"" a slang term for failing under pressure.

"As idiots like Colin Kaepernick took a knee to protest prejudice against blacks by police officers, cops in Charlotte, NC took a knee to pray before going to confront protesters. That says a lot and shows a huge difference. One is self-centered and obsessed over perceived slights, the other focuses on faith and God. A picture was taken by the North Carolina Troopers Association of these officers praying. It went viral almost immediately and with good reason. This is who we are. Radicals were bused into Charlotte to create havoc and violent chaos. They were also bused into Tulsa yesterday. We were fortunate here in that prayer prevailed and the protests were mostly peaceful. Charlotte was not so fortunate. I saw good people stand between the protesters and police trying to stop the radicals. I saw them kneel in the street praying that it would stop. Faith in God is colorblind… racism and violence are not of God.  From the Independent Review Journal: But after an officer-involved shooting in Charlotte left 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scottdead, another photo of people “taking a knee” began to circulate on social media. These people weren’t on their knees in protest, however. They were on their knees in prayer.  The photo, originally posted by the North Carolina Troopers Association, was shared nearly 100,000 times in less than 24 hours and included the following caption: “North Carolina State Troopers having a word of fellowship and prayer before being deployed on the streets of Charlotte. Please keep them in your thoughts and prayers as they work to protect us and help the city rebuild.” And the troopers weren’t alone. There were a number of people who took a knee in the streets, filling the gap between protesters and police:  People in Memphis knelt and bowed their heads as well. There were prayers said across the country and you know what? Race didn’t matter. There are a few people making this ugly and rioting in the streets. They are for the most part useful idiots egged on and controlled by Marxists whether they know it or not. I was heartened to see the Rapid Response Team from Billy Graham’s ministry there… they are good people of faith and are greatly needed in Charlotte right now. We need to turn away from this hate and division and turn towards God. He is the only one who will lead us out of this. I’m so very proud of these police officers… they have their priorities straight. Black Lives Matter is not a good group… they prefer violence and hatred, as opposed to prayer and faith.    ",true

"While Charlotte, North Carolina faces a state of emergency and unarmed black people continue to get shot dead by police, Mike Pence has a few words to say regarding the mounting racial tensions gripping this nation. To him, it’s annoying — but not in the way one might think. As black people — who have done nothing wrong that warranted getting killed — lie dead in the street, Pence and Trump are annoyed hearing about it. How do we know? Because Pence was *smart* enough to admit it to reporters: Trump and I believe there’s been far too much talk about institutional bias and racism within law enforcement. Gee, sorry black people dying and being targeted at disproportionate rates annoys you so much, Pence. Sorry the plight of black America is a burden to your message of “Build that Wall.” Thirty-eight percent of the U.S. population is non-white. When a third of the population can fall victim to institutional bias and racism in law enforcement, the conversation (or “talk” as Pence puts it) is extremely important. Sorry if the talk makes your uncomfortable or triggers your prejudices, but it needs to happen. Skirting it under the rug or blaming it on drug use doesn’t make it go away. The statistics tell us all we need to know: So, even with all these glaring statistics, Mike Pence thinks talking about it has been “far too much” for his and Trump’s comfort. Newsflash, Pence: you’re running for Vice President of the United States, not Vice President of the white community. If the talk is too much, get out of the race. We already know Trump doesn’t care about the black community nor does he want to actually fix anything that afflicts it, but Pence was supposed to give the illusion that a potential Trump Administration would care. That’s been shattered. Good luck getting the black vote in November when you completely wish to disregard what hurts them the most: systemic racism. ",true
"There is a large portion of the American population that does not believe that the Black Lives Matter movement is actually concerned about the preservation of black lives, rather, they are just looking for a reason to cause chaos and violence. Matt Walsh from TheBlaze isn’t mincing words when he refers to the group as “terrorists.” He gives reasons as to why he believe that with every iota of his being. If you support the message, but not the way BLM is going about spreading it, this may very well be the most important op-ed you read all day.  He starts out with a breakdown of the kerfuffle taking place in North Carolina. If you’re a little confused about what’s going on in Charlotte, North Carolina, allow me to explain: a black cop shot and killed an armed black man, so a bunch of black rioters decided to burn down a black neighborhood and loot black-owned businesses in order to protest racism against black people. Make sense now? Perhaps that is an over-simplification, but he’s absolutely correct. He continues: No, I suppose it doesn’t. There are many questions that immediately come to mind. Questions like: Why are they claiming Keith Scott was unarmed when all of the evidence clearly shows he had a gun? And no matter if the shooting was justified or not, why are they shouting “white cops are devils” when the cop who shot Scott was black? And even if the cop was white and even if all white cops are devils (which seems unlikely, theologically speaking), why are they destroying their own community in response? And perhaps the biggest and most confounding question of all: Why are we still calling this sort of brutal violence, mayhem and criminality a “protest”? At this point, it seems like too strange a coincidence that literally every single Black Lives Matter “protest” involves chaos and bloodshed. I almost said it “descends into” chaos and bloodshed, but that wouldn’t be quite accurate. After witnessing this play out in cities across the country for the past couple of years, I think we can now officially declare that chaos and bloodshed are the point, not just unfortunate byproducts; not the result of an otherwise peaceful demonstration “devolving” into something decidedly less peaceful. The media keeps saying — as it has reported about every BLM riot before it — that Charlotte “started as a peaceful protest” and then became violent. But that’s like claiming a drive-by shooting “started as a peaceful jaunt through the city” until the passengers starting firing indiscriminately out of the driver’s side window. That may be true, in a certain sense, but the drive was always leading inevitably and purposefully to the shooting part, just as these “protests” are, from the beginning, merely a staging ground for savagery, looting and destruction. The riots are not aberrations. They are not surprising and unexpected developments in the midst of otherwise peaceful demonstrations. They are planned, coordinated and widespread. And they seem to only be getting worse with each successive incident. Read the rest of his opinion piece here. It is absolutely worth your time. ",fake
"Another day, anotherÂ Trump controversy. While the media hyper-focuses on Hillary Clintonâs âpay-for-playâ scandal (that wasnât actually a scandal, just crappy reporting from the Associated Press), a report has found a major smoking gun regarding the Trump Foundation: Donald Trump spent more than a quarter-million dollars from his charitable foundation to settle lawsuits that involved the billionaireâs for-profit businesses, according to interviews and a review of legal documents. Totaling over $258,000 in Foundation money, Trump may have been involved in has violated laws against Â what is known as âself-dealingâ (something Trump is used to) which prohibits nonprofit leaders from using their charityâs money to benefit themselves or their private businesses. So not only has the Trump Foundation been found to have illegally contributed to politicians, it has been found to be engaging in self-dealing. And people think the Clinton Foundation is immoral? Here are some of the examples: According to the : In those cases, tax experts said, Trump was not allowed to simply keep these items and display them in a home or business. They had to be put to a charitable use. He did not use the paintings nor the helmet for charitable use, but rather personal use. Which is, as tax experts and the laws say, is illegal. So turns out the only âcrookedâ one in this race is Donald Trump, and the only fraud isnât the Clinton foundation, but the Trump Foundation. Illegal contributions, illegal lawsuit payoffs, and personal gifts with other peopleâs money (for non charitable use). Of course, the Clinton campaign hit on the issue, saying Trump is aÂ âfraud who believes the rules donât apply to him, â and that âClearly the Trump Foundation is as much a charitable organization as Trump University is an institute of higher education.â Ouch. Letâs see Fox News and the Trump camp try to spin this. Simply put, Trump needs to be forced to pay back all that he stole from donors and all that was used illegally. And if doesnât, he should be prosecuted for being the fraud he is. ",true
"Bill Clinton doesn’t want his life's work to fade quietly into the night. In a personal speech defending his legacy at the Clinton Global Initiative — from its humble roots in his Harlem office to the international, star-studded conference it has become — the former president pleaded with the crowd Wednesday evening that the work couldn't end. “You have to keep this alive,” he said. Story Continued Below But in its current version, Clinton's organization is dying. The former president's speech marked the official end of CGI, a glitzy, 12-year-old conference that convened Fortune 500 CEOs, movie stars, world leaders and nonprofit do-gooders in New York City during the United Nations meeting. There, they forged partnerships and made commitments to collaborate on projects such as saving elephants, improving AIDS relief in Africa and fighting for women’s rights across the globe. But with political pressure mounting as Election Day draws closer, the former president announced last month that the Clinton Foundation would stop accepting foreign and corporate donations if Hillary Clinton is elected president and that the annual CGI conference would cease its operations regardless of the outcome Nov. 8. In what aides billed as a swan song for the Big Dog, Clinton touted his organization as “a profound advance in the conduct and impact of modern philanthropy.” Clinton, allies said, has been frustrated that the work he has devoted more than a decade of his life to has become what he thinks is a “smeared” political target in the 2016 race. The initiative and its parent organization, the Clinton Foundation, have been the target of regular attacks from Republicans on the campaign trail, who allege that Hillary Clinton offered special treatment as secretary of state to individuals and nations who donated to the family’s charity. A series of emails from longtime Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin obtained by the conservative group Judicial Watch through a Freedom of Information Act request appeared to show increased access to the former secretary of state and other power brokers for Clinton Foundation donors — a suggestion that the Democratic nominee’s campaign has unequivocally denied. The former president saw the final CGI meeting that concluded Wednesday evening as his best opportunity to change the narrative and explain himself. In a speech he was writing himself until the last minute, Clinton detailed the work CGI has done both in the U.S. and abroad, defending his post-presidential legacy to date. The partners that worked together, he said, were “united only by a common mind-set, the belief that everyone has something to give and the obligation to give it, the belief that our actions really can make a difference and that as 21st century citizens, we all have a moral obligation to at least get caught trying to do that.” The former president, who was introduced by his daughter, said the initiative’s beginnings are rooted in Harlem, where Bill Clinton first set out simply to be a good neighbor and help the businesses surrounding his post-administration office. He reminisced about raising money to rebuild rural parts of India after an earthquake and raising money for college for children of victims of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Overall, CGI has helped 435 million people in 180 countries, Clinton said. “You are living proof that good people committed to creative cooperation have almost unlimited positive impact to help people today and give our kids better tomorrows,” he said. “I have spent the past 15 years of my life trying to advance that idea.” “This is all that does work in the modern world. People may tell you you’re making incremental change,” he added. “But look back after 11 years and see what the aggregate is. There’s nothing incremental about helping 435 million people in 180 countries.” He made no explicit mention of his wife’s campaign or her opponent, Donald Trump, but his message dovetailed with what the Democratic nominee was saying on the stump in Orlando: that “love trumps hate.” “You have to cultivate a culture of possibility,” Bill Clinton said. “You have to know we can do more together than apart.”",true
"They don’t call CNN the Clinton News Network for nothing. They’re there to defend the presidential candidate at all costs and not let any inconvenient facts get in the way. CNN host Chris Cuomo – the New York Governor’s little brother – got into a tense exchange with one of Donald Trump’s advisers Boris Epshteyn. Cuomo argued that Trump should come clean with the birther issue, just as Hillary Clinton owned up to her private server issue. “With Hillary Clinton, she had to own the server thing,” Cuomo said. “It was wrong. We heard from all the people around her that it was wrong, she shouldn’t have done it, it was poorly thought out. It wasn’t enough. Why?” Epshteyn responded that they’re not the same thing. “And Hillary Clinton — there’s no equivalency. Hillary Clinton did something illegal. She broke the law.” They continued: Chris Cuomo: She did not do anything illegal. Boris Epshteyn: Yes, she did. Cuomo: James Comey’s a liar, too? Epshteyn: He said she shouldn’t be prosecuted. He did say she acted carelessly, and as a lawyer, if you look at all the particulars of bringing that case, there was a case to bring. And he said so, too. Cuomo: No, he didn’t. He said there’s no case that could be brought, there’s nothing prosecutable about it. He just said it in his report. He said it wasn’t a close call. Never mind the fact that even the FBI Director himself stated that it is a “felony to mishandle classified information either intentionally or in a grossly negligent way, or a second statute making it a misdemeanor to knowingly remove classified information from appropriate systems or storage facilities.” Isn’t that exactly what Hillary Clinton did? Comey even said that she was “extremely careless” – in other words, grossly negligent – in her handling of classified information. And everyone knows that she had some 13 different mobile devices in addition to her private home server, which had on it classified information.

"Former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, whose conviction on corruption charges was overturned by the Supreme Court last June, told MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Friday that “I’ve got my PhD in suffering.” “You learn more in life through suffering than you do success, and I’ve learned a lot,” the former Virginia governor told host Mika Brzezinski. Story Continued Below McDonnell, once considered a candidate to join the 2012 Republican presidential ticket as Mitt Romney’s running mate, was convicted in 2014 on 11 corruption-related felony counts stemming from the over $175,000 in gifts and loans the former governor and his wife accepted from Virginia businessman Johnnie Williams. Those gifts included vacations, designer clothing and a Rolex watch. But McDonnell contended that those gifts and loans had never prompted him to provide any special treatment for Williams. On Friday, McDonnell said “there was never any quo” in the quid pro quo case that the prosecution built against him. The governor’s conviction was overturned unanimously by the Supreme Court last June. Chief Justice John Roberts, who wrote the court’s opinion in the decision, said prosecutors had relied on a “boundless interpretation of the federal bribery statute” and added that “setting up a meeting, calling another public official, or hosting an event does not, standing alone, qualify as an ‘official act.’” McDonnell admitted that the case had been difficult on his family but also noted that four of his grandchildren were born during the legal process surrounding his case. Two of them, he said, were born shortly after court hearings and all of their births “were a sign to me there is a bright future on the other side of this and things are going to be okay.” He said that even though he complied with Virginia’s laws, he regretted taking “my eye off the ball” in monitoring what gifts his family members had received. He also admitted that accepting a business loan from Williams was “a big red flag” and “probably not good judgment on my part.” “I'm glad to be vacated, but I have done a deep dive of my entire life, 62 years. What have I done right, wrong? How can I be a better person?” he said. “So now that I'm on the other side of it, I think it's been an experience worth going through. I'll be a better person.”",true
"Okay, I have to admit that last night I ONLY watched the debate to see Hillary have a seizure, collapse at the podium or go into a weird coughing fit like she does. None of those things happened. As a matter of fact everything about her look was flawless… makeup, wrinkles (where did they go my mom asked), new highlights, perfectly coiffed hair. I wondered how after months of strange episodes of coughing fits, falling, unable to walk up stairs without help, shuddering that looks like mini-seizures; how she was able to stand up for the entire debate without assistance. The first half of the debate, her eyelids looked heavy, but that went away about halfway through when whatever they gave her kicked in. My friend Nancee Jones said that she “was disappointed in Trump tonight but? he was going up against a Politician (which he is not) and a CONGENITAL LIAR. I don’t know if she specifically LIED tonight (maybe about him supporting the Iraq war??) but she is also a sociopath. There are two more debates and I DO PRAY he comes in better prepared and can get some zingers in there on those.” I agree, I was excited to watch Trump the first half, but then whatever Hillary took (conjecture) kicked in, she was like a general on a warpath. She didn’t care that her red suit already made her look aggressive, she allowed the claws to come out. She did an excellent job baiting Trump and the poor untrained debater, Trump, took that bait every time. Despite everyone agreeing that Hillary got the better of Trump, even the Liberal panel from PBS News Hour looked downtrodden, even dejected over her performance. Yes, Hillary won, but they complained that Hillary didn’t put out anything substantive. They didn’t feel the ‘leg tingle’ so to speak about her performance. They didn’t even look very enthusiastic that she had just wiped the floor with Trump’s expensive blond hair (that is NOT a hairpiece, I’ve seen it in person). Even Liberal CNN’s David Gergen said that Hillary didn’t do ENOUGH. Headline for his recent post states that: ‘Clinton crushed Trump, but was that enough?’ Coming into the presidential debate, I thought that if Hillary Clinton won decisively, she would virtually lock up the election. Coming out, it was clear that she did win decisively, but I suspect that the campaign will remain ferociously close. For one thing, Trump supporters aren’t judging him by traditional standards. They have heard establishment politicians over-promise and under-deliver for so long that they crave something different. They were quick last night to see yet more signs of media bias. Trump was an angry figure, yes, but he is also giving voice to their anger. Equally to the point, Mrs. Clinton seemingly struggled in the debate to create closer emotional bonds with voters. She has been vexed with the issue of likability throughout this campaign and in recent months her team has become concerned about her ability to mobilize millennials in the way that Barack Obama did so successfully. While Hillary ‘won’ because her ‘arguing was good’, she lost because even her own people don’t feel a ‘connection’ to her. Of course they wouldn’t, she’s a monster. Someone else was happy that Hillary turned up such a turd at the debate and he doesn’t get to vote for either candidate. My favorite fact about the debacle last night called a debate is that there are whole stories on what ‘Putin’ thought of the debate… because we really care. In reality, we don’t, we’re still ‘Merica but it’s funny to see how interested the world still is in the United States. Russia’s state-run media practically announced that: Trump Won Putin’s Focus Group and judging from Russia’s state-sponsored Twitter coverage of the presidential debate, the Kremlin is anything but a swing state.   Presidential Candidates FIRST Debate 2016 Scandals  Gennifer Flowers: The first scandal of the debate erupted over the weekend as the candidates traded tweets over who they would invite to watch the debate live in New York. Hillary first announced plans to invite Mark Cuban, who has been critical of Trump, to which Trump responded with a threat to invite former Bill Clinton mistress Gennifer Flowers. Trump’s quips are amazingly similar to the way I would respond to other’s nastiness. I really loved his twitter response:  If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2016    Hi Donald. You know I'm in your corner and will definitely be at the debate!… — Gennifer Flowers (@gennflowers) September 24, 2016   Podium-gate: The next point of contention proves that “size does matter”, at least to Hillary Clinton. Last week, Hillary’s team demanded a step stool for their candidate so that the 5’4″ Hillary wouldn’t look small and frail beside the larger 6’2″ Trump. While the debate commission denied the step stool they did allow a “custom-made” podium which was presumably scaled down by exactly 14% to match Hillary’s relative stature…this is the status of American politics folks. Here’s a look at the podiums to be used last night:   Ear Mics: The next scandal arose out of the last Commander in Chief forum hosted by Matt Lauer in which Hillary was accused of wearing an ear piece so as to receive guidance from advisers during the discussion. According to the World Tribune, the issue prompted one Maryland voter to write a letter to the Federal Elections Commissioner, Matthew Petersen, seeking assurances that ear pieces would not be allowed though no such assurances were provided. That said, Carlos Greer, of the Commission on Presidential Debates, sent out a message to news organizations on Sept. 9 banning devices that would allow presidential debate moderators get directions from their news teams.

"Washington (CNN)Most white working-class voters who are evangelical Christians -- like most white evangelicals -- would consider voting for Donald Trump. But it's not because they believe he shares their conservative Christian values. Rather, they agree with him that America is not as great as it once was, according to a new CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll. While black evangelicals are solidly against the GOP nominee, among white working-class evangelicals, about three in four -- 76% -- say they'd consider voting for Trump. Partisanship likely plays a big part in this, as half of white working-class evangelical Christians identify as Republicans. The majority -- 6 in 10 -- of voters in this group believe the US' better days are in the past and most are concerned that the country is becoming less Christian. Nearly 90% of working class whites who are evangelical Christians believe Christian values are under attack in America today. While most Christian groups -- 73% of mainline Protestants and 61% of Catholics -- share this view, only 41% of those with no religious preference believe these values are under attack. Trump often says he wants to ""make America great again,"" and working-class whites are a core of his support, but that doesn't mean they don't question the faith of a man who once said he never asks God for forgiveness. ""When listening to him, he's not a Christian. He does not have any of the values that we have,"" said Buddy Mitchell, a 47-year-old from Arvada, Colorado, and owner of a flooring company. ""I don't know of any redeeming quality of Donald Trump other than both Democrats and Republicans hate him,"" said Mitchell, who did not participate in the survey. ""That's the only reason I like him: that the establishment doesn't like him."" Christian values seen as under attack That dislike for the establishment is a strong point for Trump with this demographic. For many white working-class evangelicals, it's clear who is at fault for many of the country's issues: the federal government. White working-class evangelicals are also more likely than others to blame the federal government for the economic problems facing the working class. ""I don't think that either candidate is taking Christian values into consideration,"" said Sandra Long, an 80-year-old lifelong Democrat. ""Neither one of them is acting very Christian-like. Just a lot of things are said and done. It scares me."" Long, a Mahanoy City, Pennsylvania, resident, is scared that society is becoming more secular and will be a less accepting place for people with more conservative Christian values. ""I feel the country was founded on Christian principles. They came here to get away form being persecuted for their beliefs,"" she said. ""And now, if our ministers don't marry a gay couple or refuse to marry a gay couple, they can be arrested and taken to jail."" While same-sex marriage is legal, religious leaders are not required to marry gay couples. Darrell Pool, a 60-year-old from Lamar, Colorado, said he doesn't see his traditional Christian values honored by the leading candidates. ""I don't see my values shaping the election. There's just a lot of mayhem,"" he said. ""I think the values that were in the country's founding are leaving. The moral values are leaving daily."" Many white working-class evangelicals have no confidence that either of the presidential candidates has the ability to return the country to their perception of its former glory. ""I don't know where I am,"" said Long. ""I'm so confused at this point and time. I don't believe either one of them should be in office. I don't believe either one should be running."" Some have entertained third-party candidates. ""I'm sick to my stomach. I cannot stand Hillary (Clinton) and I can't stand Trump, so for the first time in my life, I'm thinking of voting Libertarian or not voting,"" Mitchell said. For these voters, the lack of confidence in government is exemplified in the candidacy of Clinton, who has been in government for more than 20 years. ""If you or I would have done what she did with those emails, we'd be in jail,"" Mitchell said. ""But because she's the Democratic nominee, they don't hold politicians to the same standards that they hold the people."" Many of the standards these voters want to see candidates follow are rooted in the Christian faith. Security also a concern But values aren't the only concerns of these voters. National security is also a major issue to many of these voters, many of whom have personal connections to the military. ""All these refugees they want to bring in, that's really got me going,"" said Pool, who participated in the survey. ""They have no idea who they're bringing in and we just keep having more attacks here."" ""I just think it's ludicrous and all it's for is so one party can have more voters,"" he said. The relationship between evangelicals and the refugee issue is a complicated one. Some of the biggest critics of Trump's proposed Muslim ban have been evangelicals. Christian organizations have been among the most active in helping resettle refugees, but that doesn't mean some among their flock aren't anxious. The majority -- 75% -- of white working-class evangelicals believe that recent immigrants from predominantly Muslim countries increase the risk of terrorist attacks in the US, a higher percentage than other working-class whites. ""I say let's quit bringing these people in, period,"" Pool said. ""I realize America is a melting pot and that's how America started in the first place, but we have a process here. Nobody says you can't come to this country. Come on in. Let's do it the right way."" ",true
"Fox News host Sean Hannity desperately tried to smear Terence Crutcher on Wednesday as a violent criminal who was wanted by police but was repeatedly shut down by a local Tulsa news anchor. Crutcher was shot and killed by white police police officer Betty Shelby even though he had his hands up and was surrounded by other police officers. The murder was caught on camera. Clearly, the unarmed Crutcher was not a threat to the safety of the officers, especially when you consider the fact that police officers have consistently taken in armed white suspects alive without ever firing a shot at them. But Sean Hannity repeatedly claimed during his radio show that Crutcher had a violent criminal record and had warrants out for his arrest. “I understand that in this particular case Mr Crutcher has a long criminal history and appeared to be under the influence or so the police are charging,” Hannity said, which prompted Tulsa news anchor Russell Mills to smack Hannity down with facts. “Well I’ll tell you I looked up his history and I’m not seeing a lot of criminal history,” Mills replied. “We have something called the OSCN – the Oklahoma Supreme Court Network. I was able to find a protective order from 12 years ago that was dismissed. I found a couple of financial things. There’s no violent criminal history for Mr. Crutcher that I’ve been able to uncover.” But Hannity didn’t want to hear the truth so he moved on to claiming that Crutcher had several warrants out for his arrest. Mills informed Hannity that there were no such warrants. Hannity responded that he read somewhere that there were warrants. “I have not seen any reporting on any warrants for Mr. Crutcher and I certainly haven’t uncovered any myself,” Mills said. “There has been some misinformation floated.” A disappointed Hannity resorted to claiming that he has a “source” within the department and said that “it’s a matter of time of when they’re gonna release this information.” Here’s the audio via Media Matters:  Once again, Sean Hannity tries to demonize another black victim of a police shooting in order to make people believe the shooting was totally justified. The bottom line, however, is that Crutcher had his hands up and was surrounded by officers. He wasn’t a threat to them or anyone else but they executed him anyway. Officer Betty Shelby should be arrested and charged with murder. Period. ",fake
"Kenansville, North Carolina (CNN)Donald Trump thinks black communities in the US are ""absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before."" Trump made the comment as he rallied supporters here on Tuesday and made his usual ""what do you have to lose"" pitch to African-American voters -- few of whom attended his rally in this rural part of this battleground state. ""We're going to rebuild our inner cities because our African-American communities are absolutely in the worst shape that they've ever been in before. Ever. Ever. Ever,"" Trump said to approving nods from the nearly all-white crowd. ""You take a look at the inner cities, you get no education, you get no jobs, you get shot walking down the street. They're worse -- I mean, honestly, places like Afghanistan are safer than some of our inner cities,"" he continued. ""And I think it's resonating."" His comments came despite the fact that African-Americans in the US have faced dramatically worse circumstances throughout history -- from slavery to Jim Crow laws. President Barack Obama, the first black US president, took on similar assertions by Trump last Saturday while speaking Congressional Black Caucus gala. ""You may have heard Hillary's opponent in this election say that there's never been a worse time to be a black person. I mean, he missed that whole civics lesson about slavery or Jim Crow,"" Obama had said. ""But we've got a museum for him to visit, so he can tune in. We will educate him."" In harsh rebuke of Trump, Obama referred to the businessman as ""somebody who has fought against civil rights and fought against equality and who has shown no regard for working people most of his life."" On Trump's quest to win over African-American voters, Obama quipped: ""Well, we do have challenges, but we're not stupid."" The Republican nominee has made a concerted effort to reach out to black voters over the last month, including visiting a predominantly black church in Detroit, and visiting the water plant and a church in the majority-black city of Flint, Michigan. But his visit to Flint was marred in controversy after the church's pastor interrupted Trump to keep him from leveling political attacks. He was also met with hecklers there who called out his record as a landlord in New York, where he faced a civil rights lawsuit from the Justice Department in 1973 -- which Trump settled -- alleging he discriminated against black tenants. Critics have also panned Trump's outreach to African-Americans for painting the lives of black Americans in broad-brushed and bleak terms. Trump has argued that black voters should flock to his candidacy because he will ""fix it"" and has slammed his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton for seeing black Americans as votes, not as people -- even though she has a history of championing civil rights issues and more than 9-in-10 African-Americans support Clinton, according to recent polling. Trump's support with African-Americans stands in the low single digits according to recent national polls. Despite his words aimed at drawing black voters to his campaign, Trump on Tuesday did not address the most police recent shooting of an unarmed African-African American man. Terence Crutcher, a 40-year-old black man, was shot by police Friday night in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Clinton addressed the shooting earlier Tueaday on ""The Steve Harvey Morning Show,"" calling it ""unbearable"" and arguing for the need to ""tackle systemic racism."" ",true

"Wouldnât it be nice if we could just kick bigots out of our country? Well, thatâs exactly what happened when anti-gay Arizona pastor Stephen Anderson stopped by BotswanaÂ for a visit and decided to preach hate. Andersonâs roadÂ  Botswana was an eventful one, with the United Kingdom banning him from so much as getting on a connecting flight in their country. This forced him to find a âroundaboutâ way to get to Botswana, where he intended to spend quite some time preaching. But after he suggested that homosexuals be stoned to death in a radio interview, Anderson learned that his hatred is not tolerated everywhere. âI have identified Steven Anderson as an undesirable person to travel to South Africa,â Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba told the BBC. The countryâs Constitution, unlike ours, prohibits hate speech against, among other things, the gay community (even though homosexual acts are illegal in Botswana) Â â and if youâve ever listened to Anderson speak for five minutes straight, you know hate speech isÂ kind of his âthing.â The government even tweeted to inform everyone he had been declared a âprohibited immigrantâ: Pastor #StevenAnderson, a #USA citizen has been declared a Prohibited Immigrant and as such is being deported from #Botswana â Botswana Government (@BWGovernment) September 20, 2016  What prompted his removal was a radio interview in which he said homosexuals should be âstoned to death.â Anderson also repeated his praise of the Pulse nightclub shooter. While he says he doesnât advocate violence, the victims were âdisgusting homosexuals who the Bible says are worthy of death, the Bible says the government should put them to death, so why would I be sad if these horrible people died that the Bible says should die anyway.â Anderson told his interviewer, who pointed out that the Bible supports slavery, that while he doesnât believe the Bible condones slavery (it does), âif it did then yes I would condone itâ because âthe Bible is always right and I am not smarter than God.â In the past, Anderson has blamed the terrorist attacks in France earlier this year on the countryâs acceptance of âf*ggots,âÂ has called the Orlando massacre âgood newsâ because a bunch of âf*ggotsâ died (he later expanded on that by adding that âperfect Christiansâ would âbatheâ in the blood of the slaughtered innocents while singing praise to God), has prayed for the death of President Obama and asked God to rip out Caitlyn Jennerâs heartÂ and even suggested executing every gay person in the world âto cure AIDS.â You can watch Anderson getting snaggedÂ by immigration officials below.

"President Obama is now in the record books. He just reached a record-settingÂ 78 months of job growth. Since 2010, businesses have added more than 15.1 million jobs. Thatâs longer than any president ever has before. This news comes after the August jobs report was just released, showing an additional 151,000 added in that month alone. Jason Furman, the Chairman of the Council Economic Advisers, added: this is while âthe unemployment rate and labor force participation rate have both held steady.â Â   He further stated: âSo far in 2016, job growth has averaged a solid 182,000 jobs a month, well above the pace of about 80,000 jobs a month needed to maintain a low and stable unemployment rate, and hourly earnings for private-sector workers have increased at an annual rate of 2.8 percent, much faster than the pace of inflation.â We must remind you, this isnât partisan analysis. This is undisputed data. In the past, the GOP used to complain about the low unemployment (this was their primary talking point) but since Obama took office, and with those numbers showing only positive growth, they have instead switched their argument to the economyâs participation rate. Except â thereâs only one problem with that. The participation rate is largely in decline due to the baby boom generation retiring. In fact, itâs been in decline for quite some time, spanning back even before George W. Bushâs presidency. The truth is, the economy hasnât been this good in some time. Itâs nearly 15 percent bigger, actually, than it was in 2008. Â Itâs time to start giving President Obama credit where credit is due. Republicans may not like it, but the fact remains, Obama just made history. Featured Image Getty Images.",true
"Hillary Clinton on Tuesday dismissed Donald Trump’s conspiracy theory that his microphone was tampered with ahead of Monday’s presidential debate, framing his excuse as a signal that he had a bad night in what was effectively a rhetorical mic drop. The Republican presidential nominee told “Fox and Friends” in a phone interview Tuesday morning that he was having problems with his microphone Monday night. “I don’t know if you saw that in the room, but my microphone was terrible. I wonder, was it set up that way on purpose?” Trump said. Story Continued Below After a brief gaggle aboard her campaign plane later in White Plains, New York, Clinton turned back toward the crowd of reporters to take one final question after initially saying “thank you” and walking away. While the question itself is unclear, a woman can be heard asking about a microphone, prompting Clinton to take a scathing parting shot at her opponent, as evidenced by the audible reaction (which included a group “oooh”) on the plane. “Anybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night,” Clinton quipped as she walked away from reporters, this time for good.",true
"Famed television host and veteran Montel Williams got into it this weekend with Trump-supporting Pastor Mark Burns, who took to Twitter to complain about the mainstream media’s refusal to jump to conclusions and immediately call the weekend’s bombing in New York “terrorism.” Montel, a New Yorker, was not about to let the Trump apologist get away with repeating the same fear-mongering narrative that Trump repeats after every terrorist attack that takes place in the West. Montel called him and Trump out for being a con men, shaming him for being a pastor with the nerve to support a narcissist like Trump.                  Donald Trump clearly believes that he is a minor deity and has no concern for anything but his own ambitions, and Pastor Burns’ support for him is an obviously opportunistic move by a man willing to sacrifice his principles for money. Williams is absolutely right to call him out on it.

"North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory has withdrawn his lawsuit against the Obama administration over the state’s law that curbs legal protections for transgender people. Lawyers for McCrory said in a court filing on Friday that North Carolina was dropping the lawsuit, citing “substantial costs” to the state. They wrote that continuing the litigation is unnecessary since North Carolina will have the chance to defend its transgender law, known as HB2, as part of a separate lawsuit that the Justice Department has brought against the state. Story Continued Below McCrory initially filed the lawsuit in May after the Obama administration threatened to withhold federal funding to the state because of the law, which requires transgender people to use public restrooms that match the sex listed on their birth certificate, rather than their gender identity. The Justice Department countered with its own lawsuit against North Carolina, filed hours later. That case remains ongoing. The voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit on Friday won’t bring the debate over the legality of North Carolina’s law to an end anytime soon. And the question of transgender bathroom access continues to spark lawsuits around the country. Federal judges have ruled in different directions on the issue, which may ultimately end up before the U.S. Supreme Court. A federal judge last month ordered the University of North Carolina to let two transgender students and one employee use bathrooms that align with their gender identities. But a federal judge in Texas has temporarily blocked the Obama administration from enforcing its directive that schools allow transgender students to use bathrooms and locker rooms that match with their gender identity.",true
"Washington (CNN)New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is wrong in his assessment of stop-and-frisk, a policy that allows police officers to stop and pat down individuals they deem suspicious. ""Donald Trump talks about stop-and-frisk like he knows the facts,"" de Blasio told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""He has had no experience with policing, no experience with public safety."" Trump touts stop-and-frisk practice amid black outreach ""He should really be careful because if we reinstituted stop-and-frisk all over this country, you'd see a lot more tension between police and communities,"" added the mayor, a Democrat who is supporting Hillary Clinton for president. If elected, Trump said Wednesday at a Fox News town hall that he hopes to take the controversial policy nationwide to help stem ""violence in the black community."" ""One of the things I'd do ... is I would do stop-and-frisk. I think you have to,"" Trump said. ""We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive and, you know, you really help people sort of change their mind automatically."" Trump's comments came in response to an audience member's question about reducing ""black-on-black crime."" But many people in New York's black community have opposed the practice arguing that New York's police disproportionately used the policy to target and harass people of color. After ongoing protests of the policy, a federal judge ruled in 2013 that the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy violated citizens' constitutional rights. However, the judge did not order an outright ban on the practice, but called for outside oversight and reform. The city under Mayor Michael Bloomberg appealed that ruling, but those efforts were dropped under de Blasio's administration, and the city is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process, which is supervised by a federal monitor. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated whether New York City is appealing the federal judge's 2013 ruling on stop-and-frisk. The city appealed the ruling at the time, but has since dropped that effort and is participating in an ongoing reform and oversight process. ",true
"Washington (CNN)The Washington Monument will remain closed indefinitely, the National Park Service announced Monday, following ongoing elevator issues. ""The scope of work to be accomplished while the monument is closed and the duration of the closure are still being determined; we expect to have an announcement with those additional details in the next couple of weeks,"" the National Park Service said in a statement. Repairs were expected to be over by mid-September. However, determining the reasons for the elevator issues has taken longer than expected, National Park Service spokesman Mike Litterst told CNN on Monday. ""Basically, we've had to make the difficult decision to keep the monument closed until the modernization work on the elevator is completed,"" Litterst said, characterizing the move as a ""long-term"" closure. The monument was shut down in mid-August when a cable broke lose in the elevator that takes visitors on a 555-foot ride up the structure to take in sky-high views of the nation's capital. Litterst said that although National Park Service officials previously considered the theory that a 2011 earthquake could have contributed to the elevator problems, a third-party inspector didn't ""see any evidence"" that the earthquake is a factor. A block-by-block inspection of the monument began in August 2011, after the structure experienced ground motion from the 2011 earthquake that struck the neighboring state of Virginia. ",true

"(CNN)Drawing enormous support from the state's non-white voters, Hillary Clinton holds a 5-point edge over Donald Trump in Florida, according to a new poll from Monmouth University out Tuesday. The poll found Clinton leading Trump among likely voters in the crucial battleground, 46%-41%. Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein, both of whom will be on Florida's ballot, drew 6% and 1%, respectively. Monmouth's poll produced another unfavorable finding for Trump: 54% of Florida voters believe the GOP nominee's recent turnabout on President Barack Obama's origins was made for political reasons. Only 24% think Trump believes that Obama is a natural-born citizen. After years of promoting conspiracy theories regarding the first black President's birthplace, Trump changed course last week. He still has plenty of work to do on that front in Florida. According to the poll, Clinton leads Trump among Hispanic, black and Asian voters in the state, 69%-16%. Those three blocs comprise one-third of Florida's electorate. Clinton's 5-point advantage is wider than other recent polls out of the state, including a CNN/ORC survey released last week that found Trump up by 3, within the poll's 3.5 percentage point margin of error. But it's smaller than her lead in the previous Monmouth poll in Florida last month, which showed Clinton up by 9. That margin was also larger than other Florida polls conducted at the time. The latest Monmouth poll was conducted September 16-19 using phone interviews with 400 likely Florida voters. It has a margin of error of 4.9%. ",true
"A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?   Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they’re funded by Soros TOO! It’s called ‘Common Defense PAC’ and their mantra is: “As veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.” Then on the ‘leadership team’ page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff. They feature videos and materials from other PACs that are ALSO funded by George Soros. Common Defense PAC shared one of its own anti-Trump video ads, which has a Common Defense PAC logo on it at the end, right underneath a URL link to a MoveOn.org petition called “Senator Portman: Disavow Donald Trump.” The PAC routinely promotes the Twitter hashtag #VetsAgainstTrump, which is also promoted routinely by MoveOn.org. MoveOn.org’s Political Action arm has also put out advertising for the #VetsAgainstTrump hashtag. The Common Defense PAC logo also shows up on an image on the web page for a Thunderclap campaign called #StandwithVets: #DumpTrump.” The campaign had a social media reach of more than 4.5 million people and was supported by actor Mark Ruffalo and leftist pundit Van Jones. MoveOn.org was listed as the organizer of the Thunderclap campaign. MoveOn.org and Common Defense PAC worked together on a live protest to pressure John McCain to “un-endorse Donald J. Trump.” ThinkProgress reported on August 4th that veterans “came to the Capitol to deliver McCain a petition, organized by progressive group MoveOn.org in conjunction with veterans group Common Defense PAC, calling for him to revoke his support for the Republican presidential nominee.” Common sense PAC’s July quarterly filing report with the FEC lists ONLY one donor: a Baltimore IT consultant named Marjorie Roswell who gave $20,000 on June 30th. And then the group’s Director, Perry O’Brien has been a longtime left-wing activist. His ‘Iraq Veterans Against the War’ bio describes him: Perry O’Brien served as a medic in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne Division and was discharged as a conscientious objector in 2004. For several years he ran peace-out.com, a website providing support for other soldiers seeking to become conscientious objectors. He has been an active member of Iraq Veterans Against the War, and was a key organizer of Winter Soldier: Iraq and Afghanistan. The PAC that’s suppose to be Veterans against Trump consists of only 1 conscientious objector. You can hardly call that a veteran, right? O’Brien personally started a MoveOn.org petition called “Tell GOP leaders to disavow Trump and his attacks on veterans.” The petition is probably what grabbed Soros attention to get O’Brien to start the shallow PAC. With all of these shell groups being created solely to destroy Trump and funded by Soros, do you think that Trump stands a chance against the Left? ",fake
"In a day and age when government and media are larger than ever, an America-loving citizen has discovered what the Department of Justice and mainstream media have been unable (or unwillingly) to un-earth: Proof that Hillary  Clinton conspired to cover up her “un-wise” use of a private server and email scandal. Through the power of social media, a Twitter user @GOPPollAnalyst has pieced together compelling evidence that has reached the House Oversight Committee who have begun a new investigation. Paul Combetta, the IT specialist hired by Hillary Clinton during her time as Secretary of State, allegedly solicited advice on how to remove Hillary’s name from classified emails. He made his requests from the public at large through the popular message board Reddit under the screen name “stonetear” throughout the summer and fall of 2014 and left more than a few definitive breadcrumbs. In his requests for help from the public at large, Combetta asked for technical advice on how to save or delete old emails as well as how to remove email addresses of an “Unamed VIP Client” from email servers and archives. “Hello all,” one of the posts begins. “I may be facing a very interesting situation where I need to strip out a VIP’s (VERY VIP) email address from a bunch of archived email that I have both in a live Exchange mailbox, as well as a PST file. Basically, they don’t want the VIP’s email address exposed to anyone. … Does anyone have experience with something like this, and/or suggestions on how this might be accomplished?” The House Oversight Committee has begun an investigation and has asked Reddit to save all relevant posts and data. Where that investigation goes is unclear but what is clear is that the American citizenry has uncovered what the crooked media and politicians have attempted to cover-up and have been unwilling to publish: proof of Hillary’s Clinton’s criminal activity. The investigation will likely pivot based on a very simple question: is the screen name “stonetear” definitively Combetta? In not, the evidence is circumstantial. If so, the proof is indisputable and ties a direct line between Hillary Clinton and a clearly illegal cover-up. To support the argument that “stonetear” is in fact Hillary Clinton’s IT specialist, @GOPPollAnalyst has unearthed the following connections: This story has not been widely reported and likely will not as media outlets have little incentive to highlight an average American doing their job for them. As word of this discovery spreads and the evidence presented throughout this post is presented to the House Oversight Committee, the work of the American people, both as investigators like @GOPPollAnalyst and as citizen-journalists like the authors here at IPatriot, will not remain silent.

"One question on the mind of many is why would the Clinton IT staff plead the 5th? Based on this report from the NY Post, we may have part of our answer: The FBI report noted there were many hacking attempts into the system, both while Clinton was secretary of state and afterward when Platte River Networks took over the administration of the home server. The agency said none had been successful, and it never named the hackers or their points of origin. But multiple internal Platte River e-mails reviewed by The Post show that computers in China tried on three occasions in 2014 to log into Clinton’s server and a computer in Russia tried once in 2013. The internal communications also revealed how the execs belatedly tightened security on Clinton’s now-controversial home server and frantically sought to “cover our asses” when news broke that the former secretary of state’s communications were deleted. “Any chance you found an old e-mail with their directives to cut the backups back in Oct‐-Feb? . . . If we had that e-mail, we are golden,” Platte River IT consultant Bill Thornton wrote to colleagues on Aug. 19, 2015. “Wondering how we can sneak an e-mail in now after the fact asking them when they told us to cut the backups and have them confirm it for our records. Starting to think this whole thing really is covering up some shaddy s- -t.” Thornton and fellow Platte River specialist Paul Combetta refused to answer questions last week before a congressional committee probing the server scandal. Each cited his Fifth Amendment rights. Recently Judicial Watch submitted questions to Hillary Clinton that a federal judge required her to answer. That may be why crooked Hillary almost passed out on 9-11, since the date looms. Perhaps we will finally get real answers to the racketeering of The Clinton Mafia. ",true
"NASCAR officials have been working hard for a couple weeks now on how they really ant post race inspections to look. We’ve seen NASCAR’s Executive Vice President, Steve O’Donnell, speak out several times over the matter of post race inspections and how he’d like them to go. Basically, he wants the attention off of that aspect of things so estate everyone can focus on good racing. So in order for that to happen, O’Donnell and the rest of the executives have changed the format a bit, as we all know by now! They cut out the lower two tears of the penalty system and are only focusing on issuing penalties for failing post race laser inspection if the car fails it to a large degree.  However, executives realize that this may give drivers some leeway for cheating tactics. And Steve O’Donnell is trying to nip that in the bud. In a meeting this past weekend at New Hampshire, he made himself very clear as to what their expectations from the drivers were. “I want to make clear to everybody here that in NASCAR’s judgment, any measures that are taken to circumvent what happens for postrace inspection, we are going to react. We know that’s subjective. But ask all of you not to put it in our hands because we will react if we have to. I think everybody knows what that means. We want to concentrate on the race. … We couldn’t be more clear. I hope everybody agrees with that.” It’s awesome to see the officials making themselves clear and being open about their expectations!  We’ll see how open they are in the future however, seeing that O’Donnell didn’t clarify what cheating was in their books. There are allegations that “no cheating” might even include stopping the drivers from weaving back and forth on the cool down lap. Only time will tell! ",true
"Child migrants suffered a major setback in the federal courts on Tuesday, but Congress and the White House also found themselves lectured to from the bench for failing to do more to help the juveniles, thousands of whom have been thrown into deportation hearings without defense counsel. At one level, the ruling by a three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals is a clear victory for the Justice Department. It effectively dooms a long-awaited federal district court trial, scheduled to begin in November in Seattle, on the children’s right to counsel. Story Continued Below But at a second level, Justice’s win had a hollow ring as two of the three judges wrote a concurring opinion that repeatedly invoked the words of former Attorney General Eric Holder that the government has a “moral obligation” to ensure the presence of counsel for the children. “What is missing here. Money and resolve — political solutions that fall outside the purview of the courts,” wrote Judge Margaret McKeown, a Democratic appointee, together with her Republican appointee colleague, Judge Milan Smith. “The stakes are too high,” they concluded. “To give meaning to ‘Equal Justice Under Law,’ the tag line engraved on the U.S. Supreme Court building, to ensure the fair and effective administration of our immigration system, and to protect the interests of children who must struggle through that system, the problem demands action now.” The underlying case arises from a federal lawsuit filed against the government in July 2014 by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project. The backdrop was the record number of border crossings that spring and summer by unaccompanied children from Central America. In the ensuing turmoil, the Obama administration responded by ordering the immigration courts to quickly arraign the new arrivals, with or without legal counsel. The accelerated proceedings — dubbed rocket dockets — overwhelmed the fragile network of private attorneys typically available to the children. Judges seized the chance to issue removal orders on the spot, and in the first 13 months, nearly 2,800 juveniles — hundreds of whom were 14 or younger — received deportation orders after being afforded only a single hearing and no defense counsel. The crisis has since moved out of the headlines, but the total number of removal orders issued for the child migrants since July 2014 had already passed 12,300 by the end of May. These decisions have become a very real threat to the young migrants, especially those who arrived as teenagers and are now 18 or older. Filed in Seattle, the lawsuit landed before U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Zilly, who cautiously tried to define some middle ground that would at least extend added protections for the youngest defendants. When Justice challenged his jurisdictional authority to hear the case, Zilly issued a telltale decision in April 2015 that effectively split the baby. On the narrow statutory grounds, Zilly agreed with the administration. But on the larger constitutional question of the children’s due process rights, Zilly refused to dismiss the lawsuit outright and said the plaintiffs deserved a timely answer. It was this April 2015 decision by Zilly that brought the case to the 9th Circuit, where the administration argued that the district court had overstepped its jurisdiction and any due process claims of the children were subject to the limits imposed by Congress. “Whatever Congress provides them, is their due process,” a Justice attorney told the court bluntly in one exchange when the case was argued in July. That did not sit well with the panel, but at the same time, the judges faulted the plaintiffs trying to go around the narrow legal path set out by Congress for any such appeals. It is this legal path — governing deportation appeals — that is at the nub of the jurisdictional fight. As set out in statute, all such deportation appeals must first go to the Board of Immigration Appeals, which is part of the same immigration court system that has dealt so harshly with the children. Only after exhausting this remedy can a defendant next file a petition for review and get a hearing with the respective federal appeals court for his or her circuit. Advocates for the children argue that this poses a Catch-22 in that no child without an attorney can be expected to navigate such a complicated appeals process. The system becomes punitive, they say, and effectively denies due process, requiring the courts to intervene. In truth, Zilly, appointed to the federal bench by former President Ronald Reagan, has struggled openly with the very same legal dilemma from the outset of the lawsuit two years ago. He ultimately felt that the constitutional due process question had sufficient weight to demand a timely court hearing and allow him to move ahead for at least the youngest children. Time and again, he showed a special concern for those under 14 years old. So much so that in a recent filing, the plaintiffs argued for a summary judgment at least for this “subclass” of child migrants. The appeals panel clearly shared some of that concern but wanted a tidier path to get to an answer and around the federal statutes. Having failed to find one, Tuesday’s ruling wipes out what has been years of work by child advocates trying to get a court hearing on the right-to-counsel issue. “The 9th Circuit today held that the courthouse doors are effectively closed to thousands of children whose only opportunity to seek appointed counsel in their immigration proceedings is through this case,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, who has been the ACLU’s lead counsel on the case. “The court issued that ruling even as it simultaneously recognized that virtually all children cannot represent themselves in immigration proceedings.” “We disagree with this decision, and will continue the fight to ensure that the claims of these children to appointed counsel receive their day in court. In light of the 9th Circuit’s recognition of the moral imperative at stake, we again call on the Obama administration to exercise its power to cease its unjust practice of requiring children to represent themselves in immigration court.” Matt Adams, who has taken the lead in the case for the Northwest Immigrant Rights Project, was scathing in his frustration with the court’s ruling. “The court determined that a theoretical possibility for judicial review suffices even where as a practical matter, the thousands of unrepresented children will be ordered deported without ever having an opportunity to argue that they are need an attorney to get a fair hearing,” Adams said. “The court points to one case of an unrepresented child back in 2004 that reached its doors. ... But if there is only one case in 15 years, with thousands of other children who have been deported, this only demonstrates there is no meaningful opportunity.” Justice had no immediate public comment, but privately officials signaled little joy with the win. Indeed, the harsh treatment of the children in 2014 and 2015 remains a genuine embarrassment for the White House. Draft rules are under consideration to create a more uniform system nationally, under which immigration judges would give children more time to find lawyers. And before the president leaves office next year, there is pressure to have these completed and in place.",true
"The New York Times has joined a number of other major print media publications in denouncing Donald Trump as a liar. Writers at Quartz have noted that “in at least five articles in the New York Times on Sept. 17, including the lead story in the print edition, the words “lie,” “false,” “falsely claimed” and “untrue” appeared in headlines, lead paragraphs, and top sections of the paper’s Trump coverage. Executive editor Dean Baquet” said that “I think our investigative work—see [the Sept. 17] story on Trump’s tax breaks—has always been hard hitting. But we have decided to be more direct in calling things out when a candidate actually lies…The birther issue represents, well, outright lying. And he lied over a long period. It is a real word and we will use it when warranted.” Hopefully this dramatic shift in tone will be a cue to the rest of the mainstream media to abandon their insistence on treating Trump’s statements with more legitimacy than they deserve out of a desire to remain impartial. The right-wing has been exploiting that impartiality for far too long. The Republican primary debates were filled with outright falsehoods and imaginary statistics that largely went unchallenged; and Trump’s entire campaign is based on statements which are simply untrue. But it appears that Trump’s attempt to gaslight the nation and convince us that it was actually Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton that created the “birther” myth (which is decidedly false) was the last straw for the highly respected editors at the New York Times.",true
"Shimon Peres, whose public career spanned the entire history of the state of Israel, reaching the highest of highs (the Oslo Accord) and the lowest of lows (the assassination of his close colleague Yitzhak Rabin) in the mid-1990s, has died. Peres, who suffered a stroke Sept. 13, was 93. The Jerusalem Post said he ""suffered severe organ failure Tuesday."" Story Continued Below Peres and Rabin shared a Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat “for their efforts to create peace in the Middle East.” Their attempt, backed by President Bill Clinton, at solving the seemingly intractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict was the biggest breakthrough in the region since the Israel-Egypt accords of 1978 and offered, for a time, hope for better days. Peres, who began his public life in Israel under founding Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion, was twice Israel’s prime minister, in 1984-86 and 1995-96; he was also unofficially the prime minister in 1977. The 1995-96 stint had a tragic air to it — it followed Rabin’s slaying by an Israeli radical and was marked by Palestinian terrorism that, coupled with the assassination, halted momentum toward peace with the Palestinians. Connected to every major leader in Israeli history, Peres served in important government positions over eight decades, finally ending up in 2007 as president. He also had deep connections with the American Jewish community and U.S. political leaders. In 2012, President Barack Obama presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom. “No individual has done so much over so many years to build our alliance and to bring our two nations closer,” Obama said. Added Obama: “Shimon Peres — born in a shtetl in what was then Poland, who rose to become president of Israel — he is a dreamer. And rightly so. For he knows what we must never forget: With faith in ourselves and courage in our hearts, no dream is too big, no vision is beyond our reach.” Peres was born Shimon Persky on Aug. 16, 1923, in Wiszniew, Poland (now part of Belarus). Among his relations: a Perske family in New York City that would yield Betty Jane Perske (born 1924), who achieved enduring fame as the actress Lauren Bacall. Under the sway of Theodor Herzl’s Zionist philosophy, his family emigrated to Palestine in 1934. “To us,” Peres wrote in ""The Imaginary Voyage,"" his 2000 book about him, “Herzl was an exceptional person, a kind of prince in exile or a king without a crown who had pointed out the route his people should follow.” In 1942, the remaining Jews in Peres’ hometown, including his grandfather, were exterminated by the Nazis. Peres lived on a kibbutz and, in 1945, he married Sonia Gelman. In 1947, Peres joined the Haganah, which had been formed as a Zionist self-defense organization and was now at the forefront of Jewish efforts to prepare for the inevitable fight for statehood. The United Nations approved a resolution calling for the partition of Palestine into two states in November 1947, and Ben-Gurion proclaimed Israel’s independence in May 1948. War followed, and Israel emerged from it a nation. Ben-Gurion appointed Peres director of naval services in 1948. “David Ben-Gurion was a mythic figure, the founding father of Israel and a modern-day prophet, but he was also a real man who stormed through history on human legs,” wrote Peres in his 2011 biography of his mentor. “It was my great privilege to know him and work with him for many years.” Peres served the young nation in just about every way imaginable, including a stint representing the Defense Ministry in the United States. He served in the Knesset (parliament) from 1959, and also as leader or deputy leader of Defense, Immigrant Absorption, Finance, Information, and Transport and Communication. A hawk on defense, Peres was known for his efforts to improve Israeli forces. In July 1976, he was Rabin’s defense minister when Israel launched a daring raid to rescue hostages held at Entebbe Airport in Uganda. Rabin was soon hit by a financial scandal, and Peres unofficially replaced him until elections could be held. In May 1977, Peres led the Labor coalition to its first-ever defeat, losing to Menachem Begin’s Likud Party. It was a setback that was to be repeated: For all his accomplishments, Peres couldn’t win over Israel’s voters. “He comes across,” wrote Marcus Eliason for The Associated Press in 1980, “as a technocrat, as much at home with the silicon chip as with French literature. Technology fascinates him, be it the atomic bomb or the zip code.” After Begin defeated him again in 1981, Peres took on Begin’s successor, Yitzhak Shamir, in 1984. This time, neither coalition was able to secure a majority, so a unity government was formed, with Peres serving the first 25 months as prime minister and the next 25 as Shamir’s vice premier/foreign minister. As prime minister, Peres withdrew Israeli forces from Lebanon and improved relations with Morocco and Egypt. As foreign minister in 1987, he negotiated a secret peace deal with Jordan’s King Hussein that was designed to pave the way for Palestinian talks. That agreement was scuttled by Shamir, who then secured his hold on the prime minister’s job in 1988. In 1992, a revitalized Rabin was elected prime minister. Peres became his foreign minister, and secret talks with Palestinians began at an isolated farmhouse in Norway. The Associated Press later reported “only 10 people in Israel knew that one of the Middle East’s most enduring taboos had been broken: Israel was talking to the PLO.” A breakthrough came in August 1993, followed by a Sept. 13 ceremony on the White House lawn where Rabin and Arafat shook hands in front of Clinton. ”The signing of the Israel-PLO accord is more than a political milestone,” Peres wrote in Tikkun magazine. “It is a transformative event which touches every Jewish family — physically, emotionally, spiritually.” Some Jews feared the Oslo Accord would lead to the destruction of Israel; their objections were mirrored among those Arabs who adamantly rejected Israel’s right to exist. But things seemed to be on track as the deals were followed by further agreements, as well as a landmark treaty with Jordan. Then came Rabin’s assassination by radical Jewish right-winger Yigal Amir on Nov. 4, 1995, and Israeli society was turned upside down. According to the book ""Murder in the Name of God"" by Michael Karpin and Ina Friedman, Amir and his fellow plotters considered whether Peres should be killed along with Rabin. The decision, however, was made for Amir: As a giant peace rally in Tel Aviv ended, the two leaders left separately. Karpin and Friedman described the moment: “As Yigal Amir sat on the concrete flower pot in the parking area, Shimon Peres descended the steps beside him. Amir noticed there was only one bodyguard with him and no policemen. Yigal’s arm moved to act, but he held back. Peres’s bodyguard cast a suspicious glance at him. ‘For God’s sake, what’s that dark guy doing down there? Is he one of us?’ the bodyguard whispered into his tiny microphone.” Shortly thereafter, Rabin exited and was gunned down by Amir. As Israel went into a period of mourning, debate and pained soul-searching, Peres became prime minister again. “I shared with him days of worry and grief,” Peres said of Rabin in addressing a joint session of Congress in December 1995. “I shared with him hours of reflection and decision. We complemented each other in a determined pursuit of the only objective worthy of the task bestowed upon us by the people of Israel: to carve a new era of security in peace, to build bridges across an Arab-Israeli divide, an impossible divide. And he, the captain, is no more.” Months later, Peres was ousted. He had confidently called for new elections, only to see his standing in the polls badly damaged by a rise in Palestinian terror attacks. Buoyed by opposition to Oslo, Benjamin Netanyahu prevailed in elections in May 1996. As would-be peace partners, Netanyahu and Arafat were mismatched and distrustful. The promise of 1993 disintegrated. After the electoral rebuke, Peres remained on Israel’s public stage. In 1996, he founded the Peres Center for Peace, an organization designed to promote peace with Israel’s neighbors, as well as between Jews and Arabs within Israel. He served as president from 2007 until his retirement in July 2014. Even after his retirement, he remained an advocate for finding a peaceful solution. ""The alternative to two states is a continued war,"" he told The Associated Press in November 2015, ""and nobody can maintain a war forever. If you say we should live on our sword don't forget that there are other swords as well."" In August 2016, at the age of 93, he announced he had joined Snapchat. ""Today all the young people are on Snapchat, and I am happy to be there with them,"" Peres said in explaining that he always wanted to stay on the cutting edge of technology. In 1996, Peres and King Hussein were awarded the annual Liberty Medal in Philadelphia for their peace efforts. In 2008, Peres received an honorary knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II. In 2013, Clinton saluted him for his 90th birthday: “You are the world’s social Einstein. You have tried to put together a unified theory of meaning to unite politics and philosophy and psychology and history and science and technology. Every one of us who has been blessed enough to know you … has been made a little bigger, a little stronger and a little more optimistic that one day your theory will be real,” he told Peres in Jerusalem, according to Haaretz. “When I was a child, Israel was a legend more than a reality,” Peres said at that gala. “She emerged from a dream, and today she has surpassed that dream.” Peres’ wife, Sonia, died in 2011; the couple had three children.",true
"Former Attorney General Ed Meese, a long-time aide to Ronald Reagan and a one-time critic of Donald Trump's candidacy for president, has joined the Republican nominee's transition team, according to two people briefed on the hire. Meese's decision to join the transition team might raise eyebrows among Trump's die-hard supporters. Meese joined a slew of prominent Republicans in bashing Trump earlier this year in National Review, the conservative magazine that has led the charge against the Manhattan businessman. Story Continued Below Meese wrote in January that Trump's ""broadsides"" against fellow GOP candidates had served ""to divide and discourage potential Republican-party supporters."" ""Questionable assertions that an opponent is not eligible to run, or that another cannot be elected, or that still another lacks enthusiasm or energy, are a poor substitute for addressing the real issues that should be the basis for a positive campaign: restoring economic growth, strengthening national security, eliminating cronyism and corruption, and improving the lives of all Americans,"" he added. But with Trump's nomination cemented and the polls tightening, Meese and other Trump critics like Ted Cruz are beginning to come around. Two sources said Meese is heading a Trump transition group focused on the Executive Office of the President, which includes the Office of Management and Budget. Meese declined to comment, and the Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Meese was an aide to Reagan during his time as governor of California. He led Reagan's presidential transition team in 1980 and later served as Reagan's attorney general before resigning in July 1988 following a special prosecutor's inquiry involving his ties to an Army contractor and an Iraqi pipeline project. He is a fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Trump's transition team, which is led by New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, is rapidly expanding, with one source telling POLITICO that nearly 100 people are now involved in the effort. And even as some Republicans refuse to take part, Christie and his staff have managed to recruit people with both establishment and conservative credentials, including former Heritage Foundation President Ed Feulner and Eric Ueland, the Senate Budget Committee's Republican staff director. In addition to Meese and Feulner, sources told POLITICO that Paul Winfree, another Heritage Foundation official, is also working on the Trump transition. Winfree declined to comment.",true
"(CNN)A six-year-old boy from New York has won the respect of US President Barack Obama and thousands of others after he offered to take in Omran Daqneesh, a little boy who was injured after his home in Aleppo, Syria, was bombed. The image of five-year-old Omran sat alone in an ambulance, covered in dust and blood, shocked the world and inspired six-year-old Alex, from Scarsdale, New York, to take action. In a handwritten letter sent to the White House, Alex asked Obama to go and collect Omran and bring him to his house where ""we will be waiting for you guys with flags, flowers, and balloons."" Alex said that Omran could be part of his family, and offered to be his brother. He said he would teach him how to speak English, to ride a bike and added that his sister Catherine would share her toys with him. Obama read Alex's words aloud in a speech he gave at the United Nations earlier this week, before posting a video of Alex reading the letter himself to Facebook. In his message, Obama asked people to read the letter to ""understand why he had decided to share it with the world."" ""Those are the words of a six-year-old boy -- a young child who has not learned to be cynical, or suspicious, or fearful of other people because of where they come from, how they look, or how they pray,"" the President wrote. ""We should all be more like Alex. Imagine what the world would look like if we were,"" he added. READ MORE: Omran, a vivid reminder of war's horror At the time of writing the post has collected more than 100,000 ""likes"" and been shared more than 60,000 times, with many Facebook users praising the compassion shown by Alex. One Facebook user wrote: ""A six-year-old who has more humanity, love, and understanding than most adults. Kudos to his parents and I know the world will see more great things coming from Alex."" Another added: ""I heard this earlier today, as read by my president. Even with that pre-conditioning, made me cry while reading it just now. Neither of these sweet little boys, someone's sons, are Skittles."" Donald Trump Jr., the son of the Republican presidential nominee, sparked controversy Monday when he compared Syrian refugees to a bowl of Skittles candies. ",true

"(CNN)Hillary Clinton forced Donald Trump onto defense over his temperament, refusal to release his taxes and his past comments about race and women during a fiery debut presidential debate Monday -- a potentially pivotal moment in a tight election campaign. Clinton, who has seen her dominance of the presidential race fade in the weeks since the Democratic convention, delivered a strong performance in which she demonstrated a command of policy and a sense of humor, smiling through some of Trump's strongest attacks. She delivered the best zinger of the night in response to criticism from Trump for staying off the campaign trail recently. ""I think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,"" she said. ""And yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be President. And that is a good thing."" Trump came out swinging at the beginning of the debate, and made some effective points on the economy and jobs -- some of the aspects of his outsider presidential campaign that have struck a chord with many Americans. But the debate highlighted Trump's tendency to make false claims as he made inaccurate statements on everything from laws regarding policing, his support for the Iraq War and his contention that Clinton was behind the so-called birther conspiracy. CNN's Reality Check Team vets the claims at the first debate Appearing in the ""spin room"" after the debate to talk to journalists, Trump said he was happy with his performance. ""It went better than I ever thought,"" he told CNN's Dana Bash. A CNN/ORC poll of debate watchers released after the event found 62% felt Clinton won compared to 27% for Trump. The poll suggests the debate audience was a bit more Democratic than the public as a whole, about on par with the Democratic tilt in the audience that watched the first debate in 2008 between Obama and John McCain. One of the most powerful moments of the debate came when the conversation focused on the so-called birther debate following Trump's recent acknowledgment that President Barack Obama was born in the US -- a fact that has been evident for years. With Trump standing just a few feet from her, Clinton blasted him for perpetuating a ""racist lie."" ""He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,"" Clinton said as Trump shook his head. Trump hit back, noting Clinton's tough critiques of Obama during their bitter 2008 primary battle. 'Holier than thou' ""You treated him with terrible disrespect and I watch the way you talk now about how lovely everything is ... it doesn't work that way,"" he said. ""When you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn't work."" As the debate ended, Clinton hammered Trump over his treatment of women. ""This is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,"" Clinton said. She accused Trump of calling a Latina contestant in a beauty contest ""Miss Piggy"" and a housekeeper because of her ethnicity, seemingly throwing Trump off as he twice asked ""Where did you find this?"" Who is Alicia Machado? Former Miss Universe said Trump called her Miss Piggy Clinton repeatedly sought to correct Trump's statements -- going so far as referring viewers to fact checks on her website -- as she aimed to portray him as out of touch with the complexities of the American economy. ""I know you live in your own reality,"" she told Trump. Clinton and Trump opened the debate on a positive note by shaking hands before stationing themselves behind their podiums at Hofstra University on New York's Long Island. Their spouses, former President Bill Clinton and Melania Trump, also greeted each other before taking their seats in the debate hall. From there, the drama quickly unfolded. An increasingly angry Trump slammed Clinton for putting her plans to fight ISIS on her website -- and thereby tipping off America's enemy. ""Well, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS,"" Clinton responded, referring to his previous statements that he has a ""secret"" plan to destroy the terrorist group. Battling over taxes Clinton also hit Trump over his refusal to release his tax returns. ""Why won't he release his tax returns?"" Clinton asked. ""Maybe he is not as rich as he says he is,"" she went on. ""Maybe he is not as charitable as he claims to be,"" ""Maybe he doesn't want the American people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes."" Clinton pressed Trump on the issue, saying ""There is something he is hiding."" Trump replied that he would release his taxes when Clinton made public 33,000 emails that were deleted from her private email server. When Clinton said that Trump had paid no federal income tax in some years, Trump replied ""That makes me smart."" Clinton also set about Trump's business record, pointing out that he had called himself ""The King of Debt"" and accusing him of ""stiffing"" thousand of contractors who did work for his business. When the debate turned to racial issues and crime, Clinton said that it was important for police to work together with local communities to restore trust. Trump accused Clinton of refusing to say the phrase ""law and order"" and bemoaned the state of inner cities. He said that African-Americans and Hispanics were ""living in hell."" ""You walk down the street, you get shot,"" Trump said. Clinton rebuked Trump for painting ""such a dire picture"" of black communities. Campaign at a critical point Trump and Clinton are facing off with the campaign at a critical point, as the race is a dead heat just 43 days before Election Day. A CNN/ORC poll released Monday found Trump edging Clinton 42% to 41% in the crucial battleground state of Colorado among likely voters in a four-way race. In Pennsylvania, another key state, the poll found Clinton in a virtual tie against Trump among likely voters at 45% to 44%. The former secretary of state is relying on both states to help pave her way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. Nationally, CNN's Poll of Polls finds Clinton and Trump neck-and-neck 44%-42%. Debate prep The rivals spent the day preparing for their big battle. Clinton participated in mock debates with her tart-tongued former aide Philippe Reines playing Trump. In one practice debate, Reines assumed the character of the unpredictable nominee by praising Clinton for her role as a pioneer for women, campaign sources said. Reines even wore the kind of signature red tie that Trump favors and adopted his characteristic hand gestures in a bid to fully prepare Clinton for her unpredictable foe. The Republican nominee has watched videos of Clinton, but his preparation has been less intense than his opponent's, in keeping with his more freewheeling style. He did not hold mock debates, for instance, with someone standing in for Clinton. CNN's Dana Bash, Dylan Byers and Sara Murray contributed to this report",true

"Six months after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans, my then girlfriend (now wife), Liz, and I first arrived in St. Bernard Parish as volunteers. There we met a World War II veteran named Mr. Andre who like many of his generation had been proud and independent his whole life, never needing assistance and certainly never asking for it if he did. Though he used a walker, he insisted on holding his own food tray at the relief tent where we were working. Mr. Andre was a regular at the tent and after speaking with him at mealtime for three days, he finally broke down sobbing. He told us that every day for the past three months, he’d been sleeping in his pickup truck. Three times a day, before each meal, he would drive to a temporary FEMA site to apply for aid. Each time, he would be denied. Mr. Andre had reached his breaking point right there in front of us. Mr. Andre’s story is all too common after a disaster strikes. Eleven years after Katrina, despite tremendous progress, too many homeowners have not been able to rebuild. Four years after Sandy, thousands of New Yorkers and New Jersey citizens still have no predictable time frame for their return home. Now, after the torrential flooding in South Louisiana in August, more than 70,000 families — the vast majority of which, did not live in mandatory flood insurance zones and, therefore, did not have flood insurance — have just started down the arduous, painful slog that is disaster recovery in America. A delayed, unpredictable, inefficient, or otherwise prolonged recovery takes an enormous human toll. As it works now, the “traditional model” of disaster recovery in this country forces too many of our fellow citizens to stare into the abyss of uncertainty after disaster, not knowing when they’ll get home or how to navigate the myriad steps they’ll need to take to get there. During this time, retirees and seniors are robbed of their golden years as their savings are drained. For the young, fleeting formative years of childhood and adolescence are disrupted, and parents struggle to bring a sense of normalcy to their families while taking on the burden of a rent payment in addition to their mortgage payments. It doesn’t have to be this way. It shouldn’t be this way. People can be resilient to a point, but to maintain mental, physical, emotional and financial stability, they need predictability, certainty and transparency. They need hope and a clear path — one unencumbered by false starts, dead ends and unnecessary red tape. For the past 10 years, Liz and I have been running SBP, a national long-term disaster recovery organization. In that time, we’ve seen firsthand how Americans are hardwired to fix and solve problems, and answer the call in droves after disasters by volunteering or contributing. But we also have realized that, despite all of this generous support, there is only a certain amount of time that disaster survivors can endure, as they try to find the path home. Disasters today are more frequent, inflict more damage and occur in places with no history of such disasters. According to a 2013 study, since 2007, nearly 80 percent of the U.S. population — 243 million people — live in counties that experienced at least one weather-related federally declared disaster. Simply put, at a time when an efficient model is needed more than ever, disaster recovery in this country is not working as efficiently as it should or could. Nearly four years after Superstorm Sandy, only 50 percent of homeowners who qualify for assistance through New York City’s Build it Back program have received it. And yet, Mayor Bill DeBlasio has stated his intention to declare victory and shutter the program at the end of the year. In New Orleans, 11 years after Katrina, 3,000 previously independent homeowners can’t afford to rebuild without additional help. Citizens affected by the most recent flooding in West Virginia and Louisiana are unsure whether regional and partisan politics will prevent the allocation of federal funds. In a time of more frequent, severe and widespread disasters, the status quo in recovery cannot stand. We must not be afraid to adapt, innovate and reform our current long-term disaster recovery strategy. Admittedly, to do so requires a much larger, more nuanced policy conversation, but there are three straightforward suggestions which, if implemented, would greatly help shrink the time between disaster and recovery. First, the government should enable taxpayers to pre-register for FEMA and Small Business Administration Disaster Loans through their IRS tax filing. The majority of the information required to apply for FEMA and SBA aid following disaster is contained in annual taxpayer filings with the IRS. By enabling taxpayers to pre-register with FEMA and the SBA through their tax filings, citizens can be spared the aggravation — imagine trying to produce documentation after several feet of water has flooded your home and town hall — and delay in applying for federal disaster aid. Second, Congress should increase funding for AmeriCorps. National service — specifically through AmeriCorps — provides vital support and capacity to organizations that operate both in the short and long term after a disaster. Besides being a vehicle for citizens to serve their country, the very existence of the post-disaster ecosystem relies upon AmeriCorps and its members. Yet AmeriCorps funding is often uncertain, with lawmakers threatening to decrease or even defund the program on an annual basis. Given the increased pace and severity of disasters, lawmakers should stop viewing AmeriCorps as a line item to be cut for budgetary purposes and instead boost funding for AmeriCorps and provide more opportunities for Americans to serve hard-hit communities. Finally, the government should implement rapid, resilient, HUD-compliant housing recovery programs within the first few days after a disaster. Typically, it takes at least a year for HUD Community Development Block Grant funding to reach disaster affected communities. Waiting a year or more results in homeowner distress, community degradation, and increased costs to the federal government due to the amplified costs of mold and secondary damage. If instead, private capital investment stood up the first year or two of the recovery with a government guarantee, and was coupled with a streamlined environmental review processes that allowed damaged or destroyed properties to be rebuilt on their original footprint without the lengthy review required of new development, communities would recover much sooner. Those initial investments would then be reimbursed by HUD when those funds became available. In doing so, the pace and results of the recovery will have been sustained over the course of the initial year and the federal government would stand to save significant money. The cause of more frequent disasters is not up for debate. Thousand-year storms seem to be happening monthly. The effect too, is plain as day. In South Louisiana last month, more than 70,000 Americans lost their homes when an unnamed and unprecedented rainstorm dumped a record 30 inches of rain on the region over the course of two days. Homeowners who were told they had no need for flood insurance when they purchased their home, took on eight feet of muddy water, and are now staring into the abyss. The good news is that proven, actionable solutions exist to shrink the time between disaster and recovery. Now we must find the political will to fix this broken system. Our fellow Americans are counting on it. Zack Rosenburg is co-founder and CEO of SBP.",true

"Republican nominee Donald Trump got thoroughly outplayed by Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton during the debate tonight, only capable of blustering and babbling in response to her cool and measured fact-based statements. Whether it was crime, national security, the economy, trade, or his own tax returns, Trump was on the defensive the entire night, unable to overcome the consequences of his own selfish decisions and the weaknesses of the incoherent rambles that pass for policy positions for the Republican nominee. Immediately after the debate, Trump rolled out a pathetic excuse for his own failures tonight.  Trump is relentlessly sticking to this ridiculous notion that the system is “rigged” against him, refusing to admit that he’s shot himself in the foot so many times that the vast majority of the American people will be unwilling to support a rabble-rousing racist with an extensive history of shady business practices. Not only is it a shameful refusal to admit his own mistakes, but it’s an existential attack on our entire democracy. His mic was clearly not defective, since he continuously interrupted both moderator Lester Holt and Secretary Clinton tonight and didn’t back down off from failed attempts to take cheap shots at the Democratic nominee. His childish behavior tonight illustrates that he is temperamentally unfit to be the President of the United States, and this pitiful response is just the cherry on the cake.",fake
"The Washington Post’s intrepid reporter David Fahrenthold’s investigation into the Trump Foundation and the finances of Republican nominee Donald Trump have found yet another instance of foul play by the avaricious real estate mogul. It turns out that Trump has been using his tax-exempt charitable foundation as a vehicle for tax evasion by having companies that owe his money funnel it through the Foundation, allowing him to dodge the taxes on nearly $2.3 million in income.  For instance, the Trump Foundation received payments “totaling nearly $1.9 million from a man in New York City who sells sought-after tickets and one-of-a-kind experiences to wealthy clients.” Anonymous sources within the Trump organization indicate that the man, Richard Ebers, was instructed to pay Trump for goods and services to the Foundation instead. This helps explain why people kept on “donating” to the Trump Foundation after it became clear that not even the man it was named after cared enough to put any money into it – his last donation was in 2008. Senior Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn said that “what Trump did was provide a service, renounce any fees, and then merely ‘suggest’ that the other party make a donation to a charity of their choosing.” Which is the exact definition of shady business dealing. The Head of the Internal Revenue Service’s non-profit watchdog agency, apparently extremely negligent in his monitoring of the Trump Foundation, was absolutely dumbfounded by what Fahrenthold’s investigation is uncovering. “This is so bizarre, this laundry list of issues. It’s the first time I’ve ever seen this, and I’ve been doing this for 25 years in the IRS, and 40 years total”  said Marc Owens. It is absolutely clear that Trump is violating the rules surrounding tax-exempt foundations, rules that were written to stop this exact kind of dishonest money laundering. The consequences of those violations bring monetary penalties, the loss of tax-exempt status, and possibly – if we’re lucky – criminal charges. Trump has claimed innocence when queried on the issue. “Are you confident that the Trump Foundation has followed all charitable rules and laws?”asked journalist Sharyl Attkisson. “Well, I hope so…I mean, my lawyers do it” shrugged the Republican nominee. The Trump Foundation has no paid staff, let alone lawyers, so draw your own conclusions from that. It is absolutely astonishing that the Trump campaign would have the nerve to go after the Clinton Foundation when his own “charity” is literally a money-laundering organization that is being used to perpetrate tax fraud, pay political bribes to unscrupulous Republican politicians investigating his other fraudulent businesses, and purchase $10,000 paintings of himself. The polar opposite of charitable, Donald Trump’s greedy schemes border on the comical in their pervasiveness and extension. Corruption is his modus operandi, and we cannot allow him to turn our nation into a giant kleptocracy.",true

The 40-year-old black man raised his hands above his head just before Officer Betty Shelby fatally shot him. Crutcher was unarmed at the time. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department said Wednesday that ""approximately 12 officers"" were injured during protests after the fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott Tuesday by a police officer. Mook said the other part of Clinton's plans involves working to improve the relationship between police and minorities.

"When Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump take the debate stage at Hofstra University on Long Island in New York tonight for the highly anticipated first presidential debate of the general election, Gary Johnson will be watching on television some 30 miles away in Twitter's Chelsea office in Manhattan — armed only with a Twitter handle. The campaign for the Libertarian Party nominee is hoping to interject his voice into the debate from the sidelines through an aggressive Twitter and media strategy. Both Johnson and his running mate, former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, will be live-tweeting throughout the evening. ""Govs. Johnson and Weld will be making themselves available to the media, watching the debate with great interest, and will be anxious to point out how a third voice, representing millions of independent voters disenfranchised by the Republican and Democrat parties, would better serve the American people,"" campaign communications director Joe Hunter told ABC News in a statement. He added, ""They will be respectful and not interested in any grandstanding for the cameras or inappropriate 'protests.'"" Green Party candidate Jill Stein will be challenging her exclusion from the debate by holding a rally outside the secured perimeter of the debate hall. However, her campaign says she will not ""risk arrest,"" given that there is an active warrant for her arrest because of her involvement in a recent protest against a controversial pipeline project in North Dakota. In 2012, she and her running mate were arrested outside Hofstra University when they attempted to enter the grounds during a presidential debate between President Barack Obama and then–Republican nominee Mitt Romney. Instead, she plans to be live on Periscope during the debate, answering the same questions that are lobbed at Clinton and Trump on the debate stage. Johnson failed to qualify for the first presidential debate after he fell short of the 15 percent polling threshold for for inclusion set by the Commission on Presidential Debates. His recent national polling average stands at 9 percent, with the most recent ABC News/Washington Post poll published over the weekend putting him at 5 percent. Although he previously said it would be ""game over"" for his campaign if he failed to qualify for the debates, he now says that it is ""an ongoing process"" to try to reach the 15 percent threshold for subsequent debates this fall. In an interview on ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday, Johnson criticized the Commission on Presidential Debates over its formula for deciding who is included in the debates, saying that the panel is ""made up of Republicans and Democrats that just have no intention whatsoever in seeing anyone other than a Republican or Democrat on the debate stage."" Johnson's campaign is touting an online petition that has garnered over 1 million signatures in support of Johnson's inclusion in the debates. ABC News' MaryAlice Parks contributed reporting. ",true
"Top Hillary Clinton aide Cheryl Mills received an immunity deal from the Justice Department in the FBI’s investigation into the former secretary of state’s private email server, records shown to Congress revealed Friday, re-injecting the email controversy into the presidential campaign just days before her first debate with Donald Trump. In addition to Mills, Clinton's former chief of staff at State, grants of partial immunity were also extended to former Clinton aide Heather Samuelson, who worked as State's White House liaison and later as a private attorney for Clinton and to John Bentel, who was director of the the Information Resources Management section in the secretary of state's office, lawmakers said. Story Continued Below The newly disclosed information brings to five the number of individuals known to have received some form of immunity in connection with the FBI probe, which ended with the bureau recommending that no charges be brought against Clinton or her aides for mishandling classified information. ""This is beyond explanation. The FBI was handing out immunity agreements like candy,” House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said Friday in a statement. “I've lost confidence in this investigation and I question the genuine effort in which it was carried out. Immunity deals should not be a requirement for cooperating with the FBI."" The immunity grants to Mills and Samuelson were narrow, covering only their handover of laptops used in 2014, after Clinton left State, to conduct a review of the former secretary's emails to separate work-related messages from those purely personal in nature. The immunity came after the women were interviewed by the FBI and did not cover any of their statements. People familiar with the immunity offer said it was not related to the lawyers' testimony, noting that FBI Director James Comey said in July there was no evidence of a deletion aimed at frustrating the investigation. A lawyer for Mills and Samuelson, Beth Wilkinson, said she requested the immunity grants because of inter-agency disputes about whether some information in Clinton's emails was classified. ""As the government indicated in these letters, the DOJ and FBI considered my clients to be witnesses and nothing more. Indeed, the Justice Department assured us that they believed my clients did nothing wrong. At all points my clients cooperated with the government’s investigation, including voluntarily participating in interviews with the FBI and DOJ,"" Wilkinson said in a statement. ""The letters released to the Hill today only covered the computers that my clients had used in performing their legal work,"" Wilkinsion added. ""Because of the confusion surrounding the various agencies’ positions on the after-the-fact classification decisions, I advised my clients to accept this letter from DOJ."" Bentel, however, received immunity before speaking with the FBI, people familiar with the situation said. Former State employees told agency investigators Bentel brushed back their concerns about Clinton's email setup. Democrats on the House Oversight Committee stressed in a statement emailed to reporters that the immunity offers to Mills and Samuelson were ""very limited."" ""These very limited immunity agreements did not extend to any testimony before Congress, statements to the FBI, or assertions to any other investigators,"" they said. The Clinton campaign attributed the information's release to the proximity of Monday's presidential debate. ""House Republicans are trying to make something out of nothing by rummaging through the files of a Justice Department investigation that was closed months ago without any charges whatsoever, and leaking selective details three days before the first presidential debate,"" Clinton spokesman Brian Fallon said in a statement, noting that Mills and Samuelson cooperated fully with the FBI's inquiry and ""had already given full interviews to the investigators."" A top aide to Donald Trump's presidential campaign said word of the additional immunity grants underscored the recklessness of Clinton's conduct. ""Revelations that three additional individuals, including Cheryl Mills, were granted immunity from prosecution in Hillary Clinton’s email scandal shows this was without a doubt a criminal scheme,"" Trump aide Jason Miller said in a statement. ""At its heart, Clinton’s secret server was an end run around government transparency laws designed to hide corruption between the Clinton Foundation and her State Department, an arrangement which ultimately put our national security and sensitive diplomatic efforts at risk. No one with judgment this bad should be allowed to serve as president of the United States or hold any public office."" Miller also suggested that the immunity grants were aimed at preventing Clinton from facing justice in the case. ""What has become abundantly clear is that the Obama administration is protecting Hillary Clinton from accountability at all costs because she will keep the rigged system in Washington in place. In light of this development, Hillary Clinton must immediately come forward and promise the American people that none of these individuals will ever serve in any capacity in her administration,"" the Trump aide added. For weeks, House Republicans have been seeking the FBI's full file in the probe and, last week, issued a subpoena demanding the records. Republicans disclosed the immunity agreements just after learning about them in investigative records shown to congressional staff by the Justice Department on Friday. Immunity offers to witnesses are not made by the FBI, but by the Justice Department. A department spokesman declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the FBI had no immediate comment. It was previously disclosed that prosecutors granted immunity to former State Department computer specialist Bryan Pagliano and to a computer technician Clinton hired through a private firm, Paul Combetta of Denver-based Platte River Networks. The immunity deals for the two appear to be broader than those given to Mills and Samuelson, although no one in the probe is known to have received full immunity.

"NEW YORK — Wall Street rallied on Tuesday as investors appeared to cheer Hillary Clinton’s strong performance in the first presidential debate and rest a bit easier about the prospect of Donald Trump winning the White House. U.S. stock futures rose sharply immediately following the debate, which most pundits and surveys suggested the Democratic nominee won handily. The Mexican peso soared. The currency tends to drop as Trump’s chances rise, with investors betting on the GOP nominee making good on his promise of new trade tariffs. Stocks continued to climb during the day, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average up 133 points, though some of that was in response to a very strong consumer confidence number. Story Continued Below Market analysts say positive reaction to the debate is not because Wall Street adores Clinton or her policies on taxes and spending. Instead it’s that many do not know what to expect from a Trump presidency and fear the impact of new protectionist trade policies and possibly unpredictable foreign relations. Wall Street’s biggest fear is uncertainty. “We’re seeing a bit of a ‘relief rally’ today. Equity markets are higher, and the peso, one key anti-Trump barometer, has rebounded from its multi-year low hit yesterday,” said Jack Ablin, chief market strategist at BMO Private Bank. “Investors assumed that Trump would cement a lead from the debate, but Hillary stayed on message, Donald did not.” Thus far in 2016, markets have not shown very strong reactions to the ebbs and flows of the campaign, as many investors assumed a Clinton win. Most of Wall Street focused on the Federal Reserve over the past several weeks, wondering whether it would raise interest rates at its September meeting. But with that meeting now past, and the Fed still on hold, investors and traders are paying closer attention to the 2016 race and taking the prospect of a Trump win more seriously, greeting news of his rise in the polls with bouts of selling. “There was certainly a reaction in the futures, and that was clearly related to the debate,” said Jim Paulsen of Wells Capital Management. “Traders clearly decided before the debate that a Trump win would be bad and a Clinton win would be good.” But Paulsen cautioned not to read too much into Tuesday’s market action. “Overall, there’s not much evidence of a big election impact on the markets, because there has been so much else going on with global growth, earnings and the Fed.” One area where a 2016 effect clearly shows up is in the currency markets, particularly the peso versus the U.S. dollar. The peso plunged 8 percent in the three weeks leading up to Monday night’s debate as Trump rose in the polls to a virtual deadlock with Clinton. After the debate, the peso rallied over 2 percent against the dollar, suggesting investors viewed Clinton as the winner. Trump continued his attack on Mexico as an unfair trading partner during the debate and once again ripped the North American Free Trade Agreement as a disaster and the worst trade deal in history. “Our jobs are fleeing the country. They’re going to Mexico. They’re going to many other countries,” Trump said at the outset of the debate. “The NAFTA agreement is defective. Just because of the tax and many other reasons.” Trump also again threatened new taxes on Mexican imports, something that could lead to fewer exports from the country and thus a weaker economy and currency. Clinton, by contrast, is viewed by many on Wall Street as generally favorable toward trade — despite her avowed skepticism about the Trans-Pacific Partnership — and unlikely to unleash new protectionist policies. So when Clinton does well, markets tend to rise along with the peso. “Most people viewed Hillary as the winner of that debate, and markets clearly want Hillary to win rather than Trump; you can tell that from the way it trades,” said Steve Massocca, managing director at Wedbush Securities in San Francisco. “People are very concerned about Trump’s trade policies being bad for the economy, and then there is the crazy factor. He comes across as having an irresponsible attitude at times and thin skin that would make him more reactionary than a president would ordinarily be.” Massocca and others noted that while Wall Street does not look favorably on all of Clinton’s proposed tax increases — especially on the wealthy — she is a very well-known quantity, having been in public life for decades, including as a senator from New York. She has also raised millions of dollars from Wall Street and given highly paid speeches to Goldman Sachs and other banking groups. In addition, many big investors believe Clinton will likely be constrained by at least one side of Capitol Hill as president. That would mean more of the same kind of economic policies seen since divided government began after the 2010 midterm elections. “Somewhere along the way, everyone decided Clinton meant stability and Trump meant volatility and uncertainty,” said Paulsen. “And if it’s Clinton, there won’t be all that much she can do and it will be like Obama for the last six years.” Trump has also spooked some investors by referring to the current market as a “big, fat, ugly bubble” and suggesting it is going to burst in the near future. He has also taken the unusual step of publicly and repeatedly criticizing Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, something presidential candidates and presidents generally stay away from, given that the central bank is supposed to be largely insulated from the daily grind of partisan politics. The fear is that as president, Trump could be extraordinarily involved in monetary policy, possibly damaging both the economy and financial markets. Trump supporters argue that his presidency would actually be very good for stocks and the economy, with large tax cuts for corporations and individuals and a reduction in regulations that businesses often complain choke off stronger growth. He’s also pledged to bring back the more than $2 trillion in cash U.S. companies currently have overseas while spending hundreds of billions on infrastructure, all of which could be stimulative to the economy and good for stock prices. Trump tried to make that case in the debate on Monday night. “My tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan,” he said. “I’m very proud of it. It will create tremendous numbers of new jobs. But regulations, you are going to regulate these businesses out of existence,” he said to Clinton. “I’m really calling for major jobs, because the wealthy are going create tremendous jobs. They’re going to expand their companies. They’re going to do a tremendous job.”",true
"(CNN)Former President Bill Clinton sought to address concerns about his family's namesake foundation in an interview Monday, admitting that while ""it was natural"" for donors to seek favors from the Clintons, he'd ""trusted"" that the State Department under Hillary Clinton would appropriately handle potential conflicts of interest. ""It was natural for people who've been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn't do anything they shouldn't do,"" Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. He also maintained that he would sever his connection to the Clinton Foundation if Hillary Clinton is elected president to remove any conflict-of-interest concerns, though he acknowledged the move would be ""hard."" ""It is hard, but you know, if Hillary is elected, I'm looking forward to it,"" Clinton said. He noted that he's worked for the foundation ""longer than I've ever had any job -- and I loved it."" ""And you know, we always say in response to our critics that nobody in my family ever took a penny out of this foundation and put millions of dollars in. But I would have paid more to do this job. It was the most fun thing I've ever done,"" Clinton added. The former president pushed back on criticism that donors to the Clintons Foundation engaged in a ""pay-to-play"" scheme, whereby donations to the foundation bought influence with Hillary Clinton during her term as Secretary of State. He pointed to the lack of evidence of any such quid-pro-quos, and accused critics of ""smearing"" him and his wife, according to NPR. ""In real life, if somebody tells a lie about you, and I find out it is, I like you more and them less. In political life, they just keep on smearing you -- even if it all comes to nothing -- people will like you less and won't hold anybody accountable for what they say."" Clinton also praised his wife for weathering criticism during her presidential campaign. ""I wonder if there's a man in America that could have taken what she's been through in the last year and a half."" ",true
"Donald Trump, the supposed “law and order” candidate, painted a very bleak picture of what life in the “inner cities” was like. “We have a situation where we have inner cities, African-Americans, Hispanics are living in hell because it’s so dangerous” said the Republican nominee a few hours earlier. He cited former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s unconstitutional and discriminatory “stop-and-frisk” policy as a solution for crime in urban centers. But his account didn’t match up with the facts, and he was called out by the police department in his own city for his blatant falsehoods and the implication that the NYPD isn’t good at their jobs. The Assistant Commissioner for Communication & Public Information of the NYPD, J. Peter Donald, fact-checked Trump during the debate, and has this to say about the racist Republican’s proposals to reinstate stop-and-frisk after it was ended by Mayor Bloomberg in 2011:   Trump is trying to position himself as “tough on crime” but the reality is his proposals are nothing but dog-whistles for his racist white supremacist followers. Not only was “stop-and-frisk” ineffective, it was very obviously discriminatory against minorities – and after it was ended, crime drastically decreased thanks to new reforms in policing techniques. Trump is trying to sell the American people an apocalyptic vision of America that just doesn’t exist – and the policemen whose support he’s courting aren’t buying it either.  ",fake
"After an exhausting day of ruining the lives of everyday Americans, rumor has it Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump likes to curl up in his gold-plated bed and relax with a book by his favorite author – Adolf Hitler. Long before Trump began his run for president where racism, bigotry, hatred, division, and fear became the pillars of his campaign he was studying the work of man who is responsible for the third-most murders in human history. According to a 1990 Vanity Fair article written by Marie Brenner, Trump’s ex-wife Ivana, spilled the beans on Trump’s love affair with Hitler: Ivana Trump told her lawyer Michael Kennedy that from time to time her husband reads a book of Hitler’s collected speeches, My New Order, which he keeps in a cabinet by his bed. Kennedy now guards a copy of My New Order in a closet at his office, as if it were a grenade. Hitler’s speeches, from his earliest days up through the Phony War of 1939, reveal his extraordinary ability as a master propagandist. When the pathologically lying Trump was confronted about owning the book he feigned ignorance. The interviewer asked him, “Did your cousin John give you the Hitler speeches?” Trump was shocked and attempted to deflect the question by asking a question, “Who told you that?” but he then confirmed he owned the book, “Actually, it was my friend Marty Davis from Paramount who gave me a copy of “Mein Kampf”, and he’s a Jew.” That Trump would even admit to owning the book is bad enough, but his justification for owning the book offers a window into his contorted carnival house of mirrors logic. Trump reasons it’s okay to read about Hitler hating Jews, because his Jewish friend gifted it to him, and wouldn’t it be rude to discard the gift without giving it a thorough read? Trump lied about lying, as is his standard fare. Marty Davis did indeed confirm giving Trump the book, but it was Hitler’s “My Jewish Order” not “Mein Kampf.” Whether or not that is worse is up for debate. Davis went on to say he isn’t Jewish, but that he and Trump are friends. Then, likely after realizing he had outed himself as xenophobic towards Jewish people, Trump back peddled claiming even if he had Hitler’s book he wouldn’t read it. Trump said, “If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them.” What does he mean he’s not saying he has the speeches? He literally confirmed he had them moments earlier! While it is an exercise in one’s gag reflex to picture Trump in bed, it is natural to picture him with a Nazi swastika draped over his headboard, while filling his brain with strategies to bamboozle and terrorize the public. Trump’s campaign has been ripped from Hitler’s playbook of demonizing minorities and blaming them for the ills of a nation, which is all the more reason why Trump must be prevented from winning the presidency in less than seven weeks. If Trump has been studying Hitler for almost 30 years it is too generous of a leap to believe Trump was only interested in Hitler’s rise to power, and in fact will continue to crib Hitler’s strategies if and when he assumes power himself.",fake
"One brave police chief in Ohio is speaking out over the killing of Terence Crutcher by police in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In two tweets, Rodney Muterspaw — police chief of Middletown, Ohio, just outside of Cincinnati — sharply criticized his fellow police officers in response to the killing of 40-year-old father of four Terence Crutcher, who was killed shortly after his SUV broke down on the way home from a community college class. Without mentioning the officer by name, Muterspaw said officers who killed without exhausting all other options were “making [law enforcement] look bad.” As an officer I am so sick and drained of some cops doing things like this. You are making us all look bad. STOP. #TerenceCruthcher — R_Muterspaw (@RodneyMute) September 20, 2016  Muterspaw added that he was “sick of seeing death and hate” and implored his colleagues in law enforcement to embrace “compassion and empathy.” Life is precious man. Sorry we don't all agree. Compassion and empathy is eternally important. Just sick of seeing death & hate. #Life — R_Muterspaw (@RodneyMute) September 20, 2016  The tweets garnered dozens of responses from Muterspaw’s followers, nearly all of whom gave the standard pro-police lines of argument often heard after the killing of a civilian by law enforcement. Muterspaw unflinchingly defended his words, saying he had been in similar situations before, and that the top priority was to “protect life first.” @godisgood1961 Been on that type of call/situation over 100x. You don't shoot for non-compliance. You shoot when UOF escalates. Not hard. — R_Muterspaw (@RodneyMute) September 20, 2016  @EASTBAYDFRESH @askarsismygod been in that situation 100x….communication, taser, pepper spray…whatever it takes to protect life first — R_Muterspaw (@RodneyMute) September 20, 2016  The killing of Terence Crutcher ignited outrage on social media after video of the shooting was released earlier this week. In the video, Crutcher is seen standing by his disabled vehicle with his hands up, while a slew of officers approach him with guns drawn. As Crutcher walks to his driver side window, the officers used tasers and opened fire, believing he was reaching for a weapon. However, no gun was found at the scene of Crutcher’s slaying. In the helicopter footage, an officer is heard saying, “He looks like a bad dude. Probably on something.” Officer Betty Shelby, who fired the shot that killed Crutcher, is on paid administrative leave.

"Donald Trump on Wednesday suggested that Oklahoma police officer Betty Shelby may have choked when she shot dead Terence Crutcher on the side of a highway last week in Tulsa. Speaking at a church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, the Republican presidential nominee said, ""This young officer, I don't know what she was thinking. I don't know what she was thinking, but I'm very, very troubled by that. I'm very, very troubled by that. And we have to be very — we have to be very careful.""

But maybe people like that, people that choke, people that do that, maybe they can't be doing what they're doing, okay? They can't be doing what they're doing."" On Crutcher, he said, ""I watched the shooting in particular in Tulsa. And that man was hands up. That man went to the car, hands up, put his hand on the car. I mean, to me, it looked like he did everything you're supposed to do, and he looked like a really good man."" Trump called, via Twitter, for an ""immediate end"" to the unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, that broke out after a police shooting of a black man on Tuesday, the latest in a string of such fatal shootings that also included last week's shooting of Crutcher. ""Hopefully the violence & unrest in Charlotte will come to an immediate end. To those injured, get well soon. We need unity & leadership,"" Trump tweeted on Wednesday morning, also writing, ""The situations in Tulsa and Charlotte are tragic. We must come together to make America safe again."" Violent protests have rocked Charlotte in the past 24 hours, as demonstrators demand answers as to why Keith Lamont Scott was shot dead by police Tuesday night in a parking lot of an apartment complex. Police said Scott was holding a gun, while his family said he was sitting in his car reading a book. That shooting follows the fatal incident in Tulsa, in which Crutcher was shot dead by Shelby on the side of a highway, after she claimed he was behaving strangely and feared he was reaching for a weapon. Trump, who has positioned himself as the ""law and order candidate,"" has been criticized in the past for what some see as opportunistic reactions to tragic events. Last month, he sparked outrage when he tweeted in response to a Chicago shooting which killed Nykea Aldridge, Dwyane Wade's cousin. He was accused of being insensitive, and using the incident to further his political agenda, tweeting, ""Dwayne [sic] Wade's cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago. Just what I have been saying. African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!"" The Republican presidential nominee has, in recent weeks, been trying to appeal to black voters. Many denounced his comments Tuesday in Kenansville, North Carolina, when he said that black communities in the United States are ""in the worst shape ever."" He raised similar controversy last month in another appeal to black voters when he said ""what the hell do you have to lose?"" by trying something new like Trump. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, who on Tuesday called Crutcher's shooting ""intolerable,"" also weighed in on Wednesday morning, tweeting, ""Keith Lamont Scott. Terence Crutcher.

"It was Hillary Clinton's idea to appear on “Between Two Ferns,” the irreverent web series hosted by comedian Zach Galifianakis, the program's executive producer told POLITICO. The Democratic presidential nominee took a page from President Barack Obama’s playbook with her appearance on “Between Two Ferns” Thursday. Clinton’s team got the ball rolling only after the Democratic presidential nominee told the Senate Democratic Caucus how impressed she was with Obama’s 2014 appearance on the show to pitch the Affordable Care Act. “It was actually her idea, strangely enough,” comedian Scott Aukerman, who directs and executive produces the web series, said. “… She told her team she wanted to do it and that she really liked the one with President Obama, so that kind of made the process really easy. We didn’t have to go through the hoops we sometimes have to go through in order to even get Hollywood people to do it.” The interview was taped on Sept. 9, the same day Clinton was diagnosed with pneumonia by her doctor. It wasn’t until later that the Funny or Die production team found out Clinton had been fighting pneumonia when she settled in for the interview. Aukerman said she arrived at the end of the day, a couple of hours behind their original scheduled time, but the crew had no idea she had been feeling unwell. “We kind of went, ‘she had pneumonia?!,’” Aukerman said. “We couldn’t believe it. The one clue we had was that she was drinking hot water.” The interview was taped at the New York Historical Society, and Aukerman said it was mostly improvised. As a result of the improvisation, most of the questions Galifianakis asked Clinton had not been cleared with the candidate or with Clinton’s team. Aukerman said that it is unlikely that Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, will make a similar appearance on the show. “No, we have not invited Trump to do 'Between Two Ferns,'” Aukerman said. “I don’t think he would do it … I don’t think he has thick enough skin."" ""I wouldn’t be surprised if his team reached out, but I’d be surprised if it ever were to happen in the same way this happened, with us being able to improvise questions,"" he added. If Trump does do the show, don't be surprised if it is quietly released with little fanfare, just as Clinton's interview was. ""We hadn’t done one in a couple years so we don’t overdo them, so every time we do one, it’s a surprise,"" Aukerman said. ""We don’t put out press releases that we're about to put one out, we sneak them out in the middle of the night.""",true
"Washington (CNN)Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid called Donald Trump a racist on the Senate floor Monday, an escalation in the Nevada lawmaker's war of words against the GOP presidential nominee in recent weeks. ""Donald Trump is a racist,"" he said. Reid's direct comment goes further than the retiring five-term senator was willing to ten days ago during an interview with CNN's Manu Raju. When asked then if he thought Trump is a racist, Reid responded: ""All you guys have a job to do. You make that decision. I'm not going to."" Previously, Reid excoriated Trump from the Senate floor, calling him a ""spoiled brat,"" ""a con artist"" and a ""human leech who will bleed the country."" And at a September 13 news conference Reid ripped Trump for being overweight and over his eating habits, charging that the media ""magnified"" Hillary Clinton's recent bout with pneumonia. ""Take a look at this character that's running for president. He complains about her health. What does he do? He's 70 years old. He's not slim and trim. He brags about eating fast food every day. Look at his health a little bit,"" Reid said. Sean Spicer, communications director and adviser for the Republican National Committee, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Monday that he was ""almost speechless"" over Reid's remarks. ""There is a good thing Harry Reid is retiring because I think the people of Nevada and the people of this country have had it with Harry Reid,"" he said. ""Nevada is continuing to trend for Donald Trump. So if he thinks Donald Trump is a racist, then he thinks the majority of Nevada thinks so, too ,and I think that's pretty sad.""

I think he should go back and start working out again with his rubber work-out pieces,"" Trump said, referring to an exercise band that snapped, causing Reid a serious facial injury that impaired his sight.

"Donald Trump has just received what has to be his most positive poll of the general election season, showing the Republican nominee opening up a large lead over Hillary Clinton, while support among black voters is soaring to levels Democrats had not thought possible. The new USC Dornsife/Los Angeles Times “Daybreak” poll released on Sunday shows Trump with a commanding 6.7 percent lead over Clinton, 47.7 percent to 41.0 percent, an indication that Hillary’s collapsing after being forced to leave a 9/11 memorial early is taking its toll, along with the every changing explanations for the health scare from her campaign, which ranged from “overheated” to the flu, to pneumonia. More impressive and yet worrisome for Democrats, and the reason the party, all Democrat Media Complex, and Hillary Clinton herself has been going full-force with the “birther equals racist” narrative, is Trump’s massive gains among black voters in the past week. Trump now has over 20 percent support among black voters, up from only 3 percent just a week ago. Hillary Clinton has 70 percent, significantly lower than the number typically enjoyed by Democrat nominees. Notable is that voters under the age of 35 previously were favored by sizable margins by Clinton, but now the bloviating billionaire and reality TV actor has an 8-point advantage. And among those with a high school education or less, Trump’s support has surged to a 21-point advantage, up from single digits only weeks ago. The LA Times poll has before been favorable to Trump previously, showing the race tighter than most when Clinton was leading significantly. However, this poll, with Trump’s sizable lead and improving performance among black voters, has got to cause panic among Democrats and the Clinton campaign. I thought several times last week that Democrats must be really worried about Trump going after black voters with the focus suddenly being on birtherism — an issue that hadn’t been talked about for several months that the media just recently brought back into the conversation. It’s likely that Clinton’s internal polling was also showing Trump’s surge among black voters even before the LA Times poll. Look for the race card to be ramped up even further in the coming days.

"Washington (CNN) Donald Trump's debate study habits, Hillary Clinton's strategy on millennials and the latest electoral trends in swing state Ohio -- they're just some of the future headlines in our ""Inside Politics"" forecast this week. 1. Debate crunch time, and questions about Trump's prep The first presidential debate is a week from Monday, and Donald Trump has made time on his Sunday schedule for prep sessions with senior advisers. But the unconventional nature of his candidacy extends to his study habits, and some on his team are a bit worried. Maggie Haberman of the New York Times shared her reporting on Trump's aversion to holding mock debate sessions, among other things. ""He's playing it a little bit loose and in his sort of free-form style,"" said Haberman. ""But a lot of people around him are concerned that won't translate quite as well in a general election debate."" 2. Obama skipping Clinton Foundation event The Clinton Global Initiative, an offshoot of the Clinton Foundation, will hold its annual -- and final -- gathering Monday and Tuesday in New York. It's held at the same time as the United Nations General Assembly for obvious reasons: Major global leaders are in New York and can be sprinkled throughout the CGI sessions. But one big name will be missing from this CGI meeting. Julie Pace of the Associated Press notes that the Clintons' initiative has come under fire this election year. ""Hillary Clinton would be happy if she could get through the rest of the campaign without having to talk anymore about the foundation, but she's going to have to grin and bear it for a few more days,"" said Pace. ""This is a three-day gathering with lots of celebrities, lots of big donors -- but there's some speculation it might not be as glitzy as in past years. And there's going to be one very notable absence headlining this meetings, and that's President Barack Obama."" 3. Clinton targets millennials in Ohio It's no secret Hillary Clinton has issues with younger voters, and she is looking to turn the tide. On Monday, Clinton will travel to Ohio to make her case to millennials by retracing some of her early work as a lawyer. Abby Philip of the Washington Post says trying to get younger voters to relate more to Clinton is the big goal. ""The focus of the speech is going to be about her early years -- what she did after she left college -- the focus on idealism and reminding young voters that she was kind of like them,"" said Phillip. ""And also like someone else, a young community organizer from Chicago, Barack Obama."" Will this humanize her? Make her seem more like a real person and less like a politician? Stay tuned. 4. Signs of progress for Trump in swing state Ohio is always a giant presidential battleground, and the GOP primary candidacy of its governor, John Kasich, adds another interesting wrinkle this year. Kasich is no Donald Trump fan -- far from it -- but some Ohio Republicans see signs that even former Kasich primary voters are turning to Trump in the general election. There's a lot of talk about the influx of newly registered Republican voters and CNN's Sara Murray reports that GOPers surveying those new party members in the Buckeye State are finding firmer-than-expected Trump support. ""They're finding Donald Trump has strong support from Democrats who are now Republicans, Independents who are now Republicans,"" Murray said. ""People who registered to vote for John Kasich in the primaries are now backing Trump. And what should be particularly worrisome for Democrats in Ohio is that they (the GOP) are finding far more support than they expected among female voters."" 5. Mixed ballots in Ohio pose dilemma  Suppose you're working a Republican phone bank in Ohio and a voter tells you they plan to vote for Hillary Clinton for president and Republican Rob Portman for U.S. Senate. Do you take time -- and resources -- to follow up with that voter to make sure they cast their ballot? Democrats privately concede that Portman appears to be on an easy path to re-election, so it is less of a conflict for them. Ohio is a tough state, and the Clinton campaign will try to motivate every last potential voter to turn out, no matter who they support for the Senate. But what about the Republican Party's ground-game efforts? Ostensibly such efforts are on behalf of all Republicans, but GOP candidates who don't have the best relationship with Trump don't all trust the RNC to fight on their behalf. So Portman is relying on his own get-out-the-vote effort. Those who have seen recent GOP polling in the state say this is one good reason why: Some 20% of Clinton voters in Ohio say they are planning to vote Republican for Senate. ",true
"So, why should a student respect a teacher, when the Left say shooting police is ok? Thus, one should not be surprised when a student fights his teacher, as this student did.  A Philadelphia high school student is facing charges after video emerged of the boy getting into a violent fight with his teacher. The fight broke out at Lincoln High School on Monday, police say. The 16-year-old boy was late to class and began arguing with his 44-year-old teacher.  The confrontation soon moved out into the hallway, and developed into a fist fight. Grainy video of the bust-up quickly appeared on Facebook, filmed by other students who watched on in horror. Teachers have a tough job. The difficulty of teaching has been produced by Liberals.   ",true
"This is just disgraceful. Texas… you can do better than this. A judge took to Facebook to vent her feelings after seeing a police officer named Sgt. Demetrick Pennie sue Black Lives Matter and others for causing disparagement of police and causing racial division. He also charges their actions led to the deaths of five officers in Dallas and others across the country. For that, this judge called him a clueless slave. Others on her Facebook page called him derogatory names and went to town on the officer. One of them was a Texas State Representative, if you can believe it. Sergeant Pennie recently petitioned the federal court to expedite his case due to the incoming threats received. Everything is about race now and cop-hatred. I don’t even recognize my country anymore. Andrea Martin, 304th District Court Judge in Dallas County (D), should be removed from the bench permanently. She is supposed to be non-partisan, unbiased and fair as a judge. She is obviously not. She should be reported to the state bar and held accountable.  From Breitbart: A Texas judge likened a black Dallas Police Sergeant to a clueless slave in response to the cop’s lawsuit against Black Lives Matter and its high-profile supporters. Andrea Martin, 304th District Court Judge in Dallas County (D), told her network of friends on Facebook Saturday that Sgt. Demetrick Pennie was like a slave that Harriet Tubman could not free because he could not comprehend his own bondage. The post elicited a number of supporters to Judge Martin’s sentiment, typically calling Pennie a “coon” and other derisive messages. A sitting Texas State Representative apparently joined the racialist banter as well.  Martin’s thoughts led others to compare Pennie to a “coon”, “Judas” and Samuel L. Jackson’s house slave character “Stephen” in the 2012 film, Django Unchained. The derisive comments were repeatedly cheered by Martin’s lines of “laughing-so-hard-I’m-crying” emojis and others.     Texas State Representative Eric Johnson (D – Dallas, Mesquite) also appears to join in with a “Stephen” reference via his Facebook account. Judge Martin currently serves in the 304th Juvenile District Court. She originally graduated from Texas Wesleyan University School of Law in 2000 and later worked for the Dallas County District Attorney as a general prosecutor and subsequently represented Child Protective Services. Texas State Representative Eric Johnson (D – Dallas, Mesquite) should be recalled immediately as well. Such behavior is unbecoming of a state leader. These people are stone cold racists and they are pushing bigotry and hate. These are the sentiments and comments that tear communities apart. They are extremely destructive. All elected officeholders should be held accountable for their racially-derogatory language.  ",true
"While the media was busy talking about the NYC bombings and the arrest of Ahmad Khan Rahami, there was another bomb threat in Houston, Texas that did not receive nearly the same media attention. LA Times reporter Matt Pierce felt the incident was doomed from the start, and took to Twitter to imply that this story was pretty much guaranteed to not receive as much attention as the NYC bombings because of the skin color of the criminal involved.  According to a news release from U.S. Attorney Kenneth Magidson, Houston man Cary Lee Ogborn was arrested last Friday after he was discovered to be at the center of a bomb plot targeting Houston, Texas. The statement from the U.S. Attorney specified that, “Cary Lee Ogborn is charged with attempting to transport explosives with the intent that those explosives be used to kill, injure, or intimidate any individual or to damage or destroy a vehicle or building. He was arrested late Friday after picking up a package he believed contained such explosives.” Although Ogborn’s plan to attack Houston was thwarted before it could cause a tragedy, Matt Pearce’s tweet struck a chord with many people who are disappointed the media is more likely to push a story when it advances a criminal narrative that fits a profitable “news-worthy formula” usually including Islamic terrorism or black and latino criminality. Despite the high-profile coverage of several attacks committed by Islamic terrorists, the numbers just do not reflect this narrative. Research from Gallup and the Triangle Center On Homeland and Security found that “Law enforcement agencies in the United States consider anti-government violent extremists, not radicalized Muslims, to be the most severe threat of political violence that they face” due to the fact that “Muslim-American terrorist suspects and perpetrators in the decade since 9/11, [represent] just a small percentage of the thousands of acts of violence that occur in the United States each year.” ",true
"The Clintons understand the average American. They know what it’s like to be dead broke. Hillary Clinton is so a woman of the people. She’s just like you. (Except for making millions of dollars off the backs of the taxpayers and suffering from Disingenuous Lying Seahag Syndrome). Bill Clinton is just like you! (Minus being an unapologetic rapist, of course.) Chelsea Clinton is just like you! (Except for getting paid $600,000 a year by NBC to basically do nothing.) Bill and Hillary are notorious for charging a sinful amount of money to speak at events. We’re talking $250,000+. Luckily, their daughter Chelsea is a lot more affordable. She’ll speak and take some photos for a measly $65,000. That’s it. Talk about a bargain. But wait– it gets BETTER! The Hillary Clinton campaign held a super fun “Conversation with Chelsea” event at Penn State University Wednesday. And look. The Clintons understand that college students aren’t made of money, so they decided to charge students $500 to attend the event. A student could also get a picture with Chelsea for a small donation of $1,000 and could get access to the reception for $2,700. Talk about a deal! So $500 bare minimum. I mean, $500 is nothing to a broke college student, amirite? Just kidding. Even college students– individuals famous for being progressive Clinton worshipping robots– thought it was ridiculous that Hillary would charge students hundreds of dollars to have a “conversation” with Chelsea. “Although we certainly support Chelsea’s right to campaign on her mother’s behalf, we do not agree with Mrs. Clinton choosing to make this ‘conversation’ available exclusively to individuals who can afford or are willing to pay at least $500,” said Ethan Paul, vice president of College Progressives of Penn State, the newspaper reported Wednesday. “It is particularly deplorable that a $2,700 donation—the legal limit—gets a personal conversation with Mrs. Clinton.”   “Putting such an expensive price on involvement in elections really hurts college students who already feel there is no point to politics,” added College Progressive Secretary Kathryn Van Develde. But listen, kids. Hillary understands you. She really does. And she thinks it’s ridiculous that you have to go into debt to just obtain a degree. Please pay $2,700 to talk to her about it. h/t Washington Times",fake
"The National Association of Secretaries of State have told Congress to step back and let them handle it. They assure Congress that the election mechanism is secure. The data breaches have been about voter databases and NOT the election machines. The polling system is a closed system and not open to hacking. To date there have been zero occurrences.  As Written By Reid Wilson for The Hill: State officials are reassuring members of Congress that the integrity of November’s elections is secure amid growing concerns over cyberattacks by foreign actors tied to Russia. In an open letter to Congress, the National Association of Secretaries of State warns against damaging public confidence in the electoral process. The group, made up of bipartisan election administrators across the nation, says security measures currently in place are sufficient to guarantee an accurate vote count. Vote-counting systems “have their own fail-safes and contingency solutions that would make it highly difficult to leverage them for changing outcomes,” the association said. “Poll books, printed records, back-ups and back-ups of back-ups all provide multiple layers of security around this part of the process.” The association said there is no fix-all to guard against all cyberattacks but pointed out that recent hacks of voter registration systems in Arizona and Illinois are unconnected to separate systems that tally votes. The decentralized nature of American election administration acts as its own safeguard, the association said. In November, Americans will vote at hundreds of thousands of polling locations, and those votes are counted by more than 9,000 election administrators, making large-scale hacking almost impossible, it added. What’s more, voting machines themselves are not connected to the internet, providing more security. “There is no evidence that ballot manipulation has ever occurred in the U.S. via…… Full Story Here: State officials warn Congress against ‘rigged election’ talk | TheHill",true
"I’m probably going to a very not good place for laughing at this, but I can’t help that it’s so dang funny!  There has been a theory floating around that Hillary Clinton is just a robot disguised as a human. While that may seem out-of-this-world ridiculous, remember that she admitted to “short-circuiting.” I’m fairly confident that this is not a term that people often use to describe their forgetting something of importance. And then, adding to the pile of evidence to validate this theory is this little gem picked up from the Twitterverse:  Some guy right in Hillary’s face: HILLARY FOR PRISON Hillary: LET’S MAKE IT HAPPEN I almost feel sorry for her https://t.co/CKfdSuASHB — Jenna Abrams (@Jenn_Abrams) September 18, 2016   When some man yells “Hillary For Prison!” right in her face, Hillary responds with a strangely enthusiastic “Let’s make it happen!” Now I’ve never been to prison so I’m not entirely confident about this, but it would seem that it’s not a place that you would be that excited to go to. If that doesn’t have you rolling on the floor with laughter, this screengrab might:  Awesome. Just… awesome.  ",fake
"Donald Trump was in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Thursday for a campaign speech. He took time to address the unrest around the country in the wake of recent officer-involved shootings. Here’s what he said: “Before going any further today, I want to address the turmoil unfolding right now in our country. And it seems to be a never-ending problem. America desperately needs unity, and it needs the spirit of togetherness, that has not only gotten us through our toughest times – because we’ve had some tough times – but which has lifted us up in the past to our greatest achievements as a nation. “Everyday I see people of different backgrounds working together for common good, and we need to bring that spirit to every part of our country and become one American nation, united by shared values and principles as American citizens. We have to do it. And we have to respect our flag. We have to respect our flag. “We all have to walk a mile in someone else’s shoes and see things through their eyes, and then get to work fixing our very wounded country. We have some real problems. And we do have a wounded country. “Many Americans are watching the unrest in Charlotte unfolding right before their eyes on the TV screen. Others are witnessing the chaos and the violence firsthand. Our country looks bad to the world, especially when we are supposed to be the world’s leader. How can we lead when we can’t even control our own cities? “We honor and recognize the right of all Americans to peacefully assemble, protest, and demonstrate. But there is no right to engage in violent disruption or to threaten the public safety and peace of others. “Every single American in our country is entitled to live in a safe community. The violence against our citizens and our law enforcement must be brought to a very rapid end. “The people who will suffer the most as a result of these riots are law-abiding African-American residents who live in these communities where the crime is so rampant. It’s their jobs, housing market, schools, economic conditions that will suffer. And the first duty of government is to protect their wellbeing and safety. We have to do that. “There is no compassion in tolerating lawless conduct. Crime and violence is an attack on the poor and will never be accepted in a Trump administration. “Our job is not to make life more comfortable for the violent disrupter, but to make life more comfortable for the African-American parent trying to raise their kids in peace, to walk their children to school and get their children great educations. We have to cherish and protect those people.”   The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.",true
"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed: Hereâs Google:  Naturally, my reaction was âoh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wifeâs campaign now?â Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people donât do, to find out the real story â and the real story is that there is no pay to play. âIt was natural for people whoâve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldnât do anything they shouldnât do,â Clinton toldÂ NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning.Â  Source: CNN In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesnât mean theyâll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but thereâs no evidence they got them. Now, letâs talk about the foundation the media doesnât like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasnât given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trumpâs charitable foundation over concerns that it âengaged in some improprietyâ as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled othersâ contributions âto make them appear to have come from himâ although he âhasnât given to the foundation since 2008.â Source: Media Matters Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clintonâs candidacy: Journalists have been criticized for the âdouble standardâ in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clintonâs pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Postâs reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trumpâs Dr. Oz stunt. All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton âscandalâ (if you call getting sick a âscandalâ) while ignoring every scandal in Trumpâs closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

"Melbourne, Florida (CNN)Donald Trump declared himself the unquestionable winner of his first debate against Hillary Clinton during a rally Tuesday night, then relived the entire debate before a Florida crowd of supporters, this time with the help of a teleprompter -- and without Clinton baiting him. The Republican presidential nominee ticked down a list of issues he failed to sufficiently hammer Clinton on during their 90-minute bout -- from her foreign policy failures to her use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state. He also insisted on defending two factually incorrect statements he made the previous night. Trump touted unscientific, online post-debate polls as ""things of beauty."" He also again claimed to be ""holding back"" during the faceoff because he ""didn't want to do anything to embarrass"" Clinton. That comment came after blaming debate moderator Lester Holt of NBC News for being tough on him earlier in the day, ""For 90 minutes I watched her very carefully and I was also holding back. I didn't want to do anything that embarrassed her,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""For 90 minutes, she argued against change, while I called for dramatic change. We have to have dramatic change."" But while he spent much of the debate on the defense, Trump was free to unleash on Clinton without abandon as he rallied thousands of supporters Tuesday night in an airplane hangar. He slammed Clinton for having ""defended every major failure she helped create,"" placing particular emphasis on Clinton's track record as secretary of state. ""Iraq and Libya are in chaos,"" Trump said. ""Here in America we've seen one Islamic terror strike after another."" Trump pointed to Clinton's decades-old career in the political spotlight -- arguing she has not accomplished enough, and failed too often, in that time period. ""I kept saying for 26 years you've been doing nothing,"" Trump said. ""She's the candidate of yesterday. And ours is the campaign and we're the people of the future."" Clinton was the first lady of Arkansas and then the United States before she was elected for the first time to public office in 2000 as a US senator from New York. And while Clinton made it through the debate on Monday with relatively few attacks from Trump on the subject, on Tuesday, Trump attacked her over her email practices, including her false assertion she neither sent nor received information marked classified. ""Another Crooked Hillary lie,"" Trump said. ""Have you ever seen a greater embarrassment to our country?"" Clinton is ""an insider fighting only for her donors and insiders,"" Trump said, touting his outsider status. But Trump also entrenched himself on two issues the debate's moderator, Holt, called out on for being factually inaccurate. He insisted the stop-and-frisk practice used in New York City that a federal judge ruled unconstitutional in 2013 was constitutional. And he argued that he was ""against going into Iraq,"" even though he did not publicly oppose the war before it started, expressed support for it a month before Congress voted to approve military force and even praised the invasion as a ""tremendous success."" And earlier in the day, as the Clinton campaign sought to highlight disparaging comments Trump made about former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, Trump reiterated his criticism. ""She gained a massive amount of weight, and it was a real problem,"" he said on ""Fox and Friends."" Trump on Tuesday also returned to his characterization of the press as ""the most dishonest people I've ever dealt with"" and, as he continued to review the previous night's debate, suggested Clinton's success was tied to the ""mainstream media."" ""Without the mainstream media, folks, she wouldn't even be here. She wouldn't even have a chance,"" Trump said. But Trump also signaled that he and his campaign took note of his strongest moments in the debate. Trump hammered home his commitment to addressing trade imbalances Tuesday night and pointed to his back-and-forth with Clinton over trade, particularly when he called her out for calling the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal the ""gold standard"" of trade agreements. Clinton now opposes the TPP trade deal. ""The American people rendered their verdict. The post-debate polls as I said to you were so great, but we exposed Hillary Clinton's real position on NAFTA which was by the way the single worst deal as you'll ever see and Trans-Pacific Partnership -- another great disaster that she lied about,"" Trump said.

"A liberal attempt to revive the so-called public option — a government-run insurance plan to shore up gaps in the Affordable Care Act — is opening old wounds between the Democratic Party’s liberal and moderate wings. Thirty-three mostly liberal Democrats, including all the Senate leadership, have signed onto a nonbinding Senate resolution introduced last Friday to add the public option to Obamacare, arguing that it is needed to fix problems with the president’s signature health care law. Story Continued Below But missing from the list are vice-presidential nominee Tim Kaine and a half-dozen other moderates who face reelection in 2018 — when the map that favors Democrats this year will flip to favor Republicans. Kaine’s absence is especially striking since Hillary Clinton embraced the public option in July. A campaign spokesperson said Kaine is “supportive of a workable public option for health care insurance,” even though he has not co-sponsored the resolution. But other moderate Democratic senators made it clear that they remain uncomfortable with a government-run health program. Sen. Jon Tester, a moderate Montana Democrat up for reelection in 2018, said the focus should be on working “on a bipartisan basis to fix Obamacare.” “Until we get to the point that we’re willing to work together on that … we’re going to continue to see problems,” Tester said. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), who won her 2012 election with 50.24 percent of the vote and is expected to face a tight race in 2018, called the public-option debate a “distraction.” “We’ve had a whole lot of discussion about what’s going to happen to Obamacare but … we aren’t having discussions [about how we deliver higher-quality care at lower costs] because we keep discussing how we’re going to fund it,” she said. The resistance of moderate Democrats led to the scuttling of the public option when it was first debated as a potential part of the ACA in 2009. Now, the continued divide between liberals and moderates could be a preview of coming battles if Clinton were to become president and liberals mounted a serious effort to add a public option to Obamacare. Since the ACA was conceived, liberals have insisted that a government-run health insurer would pressure private insurers to reduce premiums. Now, progressives say, many of the ACA’s flaws could be repaired with a public option, which would essentially be a new plan offered on the Obamacare insurance exchanges, some of which are down to only one or two private insurers. Clinton has repeatedly said on the campaign trail that she would “defend” the Affordable Care Act if elected president. Her campaign website pledges that she will “build on its success to bring the promise of affordable health care to more people and make a ‘public option’ possible.” Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who is spearheading the effort, said that besides Clinton’s endorsement, rising premiums and the high-profile withdrawal of Aetna and United Healthcare from several exchanges makes the issue ripe for discussion. “We’re right in the middle of the presidential campaign, and I think it’s important during this campaign and [House and Senate races] to have a conversation about having competition in all the exchanges across the country,” Merkley said. He downplayed the lack of support from moderates and said he has not run the resolution by the Clinton campaign. He pointed out that all of the Democratic leaders have signed on as cosponsors. “So there is a wide range of folks — folks from states that have big insurance companies’ headquarters, like Connecticut — folks who don’t. It’s a broad spectrum,” he said. “We’re only a couple days into this.” Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which is championing the resolution, said the goal is to build momentum to enact a public option next year. Green said he’s happy with 33 co-sponsors so far and hopeful that moderate lawmakers from rural states are drawn to the idea of more competition among insurers. “Rural states have big problems with competition, and having a public option would actually be really popular in those states,” he said. But some red-state Democrats are skeptical. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who is also due to face voters in 2018, said she’s open to discussing the public option “but I want to make sure that we’ve done everything to make the market work before we turn to that.” Republicans are already trying to frame the public option as “more Obamacare,” a preview of the battle that could come if Democrats are in a position to pursue the proposal. “Democrats actually introduced legislation last week calling for Obamacare 2.0, a new government-run health plan,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wednesday. “And there are good reasons why so many of their own caucus won’t support it. It’s insulting to the millions of Americans who continue to watch their premiums spike — after Democrats said they’d be lower.”",true

"The United States made at least two separate payments to the Iranian government via wire transfer within the last 14 months, a Treasury Department spokesman confirmed Saturday, contradicting explanations from President Barack Obama that such payments were impossible. Responding to questions at an Aug. 4 press conference about a $400 million payment delivered in cash to the Iranian government, Obama said, “[T]he reason that we had to give them cash is precisely because we are so strict in maintaining sanctions and we do not have a banking relationship with Iran that we couldn't send them a check and we could not wire the money.” Story Continued Below But a Treasury Department spokesman acknowledged on Saturday that on at least two occasions, the U.S. did make payments to the Iranian government via wire transfer. In July 2015, the same month in which the U.S., Iran and other countries announced a landmark nuclear agreement, the U.S. government paid the Islamic republic approximately $848,000. That payment settled a claim over architectural drawings and fossils that are now housed in the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art and Iran’s Ministry of Environment, respectively. Then, in April 2016, the U.S. wired Iran approximately $9 million to remove 32 metric tons of its heavy water, which is used to produce plutonium and can aid in the making of nuclear weapons. While some sanctions relating to Iran’s nuclear program were lifted with the implementation of the nuclear agreement, others imposed over the Islamic Republic’s human rights policies and support for terrorist organizations remain in effect. The July 2015 wire transfer was made while the full weight of sanctions against Iran were intact, while the April 2016 payment for heavy water was made after the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions. The Treasury Department spokesman explained that the lifting of those sanctions allowed Iran “to gain incremental access to the international financial system, which opened up more options for executing transactions, such as the heavy water transaction” that occurred in April 2016. The spokesman declined to offer an explanation as to why the July 2015 payment was possible despite the full array of sanctions in place at the time. That $400 million cash payment that Obama said could not have been delivered any other way was part of a larger $1.7 billion settlement with Iran, the remainder of which was also delivered in cash. The $400 million, paid in January to settle a decades-old dispute over military equipment order by the late shah of Iran, was sent through intermediary central banks in Europe, who then delivered pallets of euros, Swiss francs and other currencies to Tehran. The Treasury Department spokesman said that the January settlement specified that payment be made in cash because Iran had previously had difficulty accessing wire-transferred funds and was “very aware of the difficulties it would face in accessing and using the funds from the January 2016 settlement payment if they were in any other form than cash.” A senior Obama administration official contested that the Treasury Department’s confirmation of the twin wire transfers contradicted what the president said at his press conference early last month. The official repeated what the president said at the time, that “we do not have a direct banking relationship with Iran, which means that we cannot wire money directly to Iran,” but did not directly address either the July 2015 or April 2016 wire transfers. “Sanctions had effectively cut off Iran from the international financial system and after several years of trying to gain limited access to its own money held in accounts outside of Iran, Iran was very aware of the difficulties it would face in accessing and using these funds if they were in any form other than cash,” the official said of negotiations surrounding the $1.7 billion settlement. “Therefore, effectuating the payment in foreign currency banknotes was the most reliable way to ensure that they would receive the funds in a timely manner.” Republicans in Congress and on the campaign trail have alleged that Iran requested a cash payment specifically because it would make the money difficult to trace. GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump made an issue of the cash payment over the summer, suggesting that the cash delivery likely wound up funding terrorism or found its way into ""some of the mullahs' bank accounts."" Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who discovered the two wire transfer payments in briefings with Obama administration officials, echoed those concerns in an interview with POLITICO on Thursday. “Oh, I don’t have any question that Iran wants the money in cash because they wanted it faster than what a wire transfer would be and it’s fungible,” Lankford said. “They announced pretty quickly afterward that they were expanding their defense and their military budget by $1.7 billion dollars, an exact amount that we had just sent over to them. So I don’t think that was accidental.” “But when you give cash, we can’t track,” he continued. “Did that go to Hezbollah? Did that go to the Russians? Did that go to the coup in Yemen? There’s no way to be able to track that.” Republicans, including Lankford, have also suggested that the $1.7 billion delivery constituted a “ransom” payment because it was delivered on the same day that U.S. prisoners were released by Iran. The president dismissed such claims during his Aug. 4 press conference as “the manufacturing of outrage” and said unequivocally, ""we don’t pay ransom for hostages.” But State Department spokesman John Kirby acknowledged two weeks later that the U.S. had refused to deliver the cash to Iran until its prisoners were wheels up from Tehran, a decision Kirby said the U.S. made to “retain maximum leverage” over the Iranians. Despite that admission, he maintained that the arrangement did not in any way constitute a ransom payment.",true
"As we watch police officers hunted down and assassinated, and we see riots rear up every time a black man is shot by police, we might want to take a moment to review the actual numbers behind these shootings. The number of lives lost by police using deadly force is minuscule. Since it is an act of last resort, it should be. Twice as many white suspects are killed in violent encounters with police, but you never hear about that. See the statistics below. If black lives mattered so much to the radicals out there, they would focus more on reducing crime and helping their communities. They don’t… the likes of Black Lives Matter, the New Black Panthers and the Nation of Islam riot, loot and kill, many times in their own neighborhoods. It’s the violence and chaos they want… not to rectify any injustice.  From Freedom Daily: 2013 U.S. population is 316,128,839 persons, here are annual percentages: ⦁ 0.012% of the U.S. population committed suicide ⦁ 0.011% of the U.S. population died in a vehicle crash ⦁ 0.004% of the U.S. population died in a criminal homicide ⦁ 0.00012% of the U.S. population died from police use of force ⦁ 0.00012% of the U.S. population was struck by lightning ⦁ 0.00009% of the U.S. population was legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense …that of the 1,491 persons that died from police use of force from 2009-2012: ⦁ 915 (61.4%) were white males ⦁ 481 (32.2%) were black males ⦁ 48 (3.2%) were males of other races ⦁ 28 (1.9%) were white females ⦁ 15 (1.1%) were black females ⦁ 4 (0.2%) were females of other races ⦁While only 6% of the U.S. population is identified as black and male, 57.9% of the persons legally killed by a private citizen in self-defense were black males. ⦁ However, 73.1% of the black males legally killed by a citizen in self-defense between 2009-2012 were killed by a black citizen. ⦁ 42.6% of victims of all solved criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were black males ⦁ 89.6% of black males killed in criminal homicides from 2009-2012 were killed by another black male ⦁ 40.6% of the police officers murdered in the line of duty from 2009-2012 were killed by black males* Police officers put their lives on the line each and every day they go out there to protect us. They never know if it will be their last. They have sworn an oath that all lives matter and they will protect people from those that are criminally inclined and evil. There are very few ‘bad’ cops and they are usually weeded out. The majority of officers are those who joined to help others and keep them from harm. You have about as much chance of being struck by lightning as you do being shot by a police officer. You really have to work at it to become a statistic. Those that are shot almost without fail are threatening police officers or not obeying commands. The statistics tell the story if anyone bothers to review them. Violence is out of control in the black community and overwhelmingly when a person is shot, it is justified. And it happens very rarely.    ",fake
"Both of the 2016 presidential candidates had their chance to speak out about the recent bombings in New York and New Jersey. There are so many differences between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, just in these videos alone. Watch!  What a difference in Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton’s responses to last night’s NYC bombing. Trump said, “I must tell you that just before I got off the plane a bomb went off in New York and nobody knows what’s going on,” Trump said during a rally last night at an airport hangar in Colorado Springs, Colorado. “But boy we are living in a time — we better get very tough, folks. We better get very, very tough. It’s a terrible thing that’s going on in our world, in our country and we are going to get tough and smart and vigilant.” These comments came just minutes after the explosion occurred.  Hillary by contrast, looked like she was half asleep (or even drugged) during her response, in which she contradicted herself within a period of forty seconds. At the 0:28 mark in the video below, she states ““I’ve been briefed about the bombings in New York and New Jersey, as well as the attack in Minnesota.” Then, at 1:08, she was asked ““Do you have any reaction to the fact that Donald Trump, prior to taking the stage tonight, called the explosion tonight a bomb, and if that’s an appropriate term”?” Hillary, apparently unaware that bombings are caused by bombs, replied “Well I think it’s important to know the facts about any incident like this, that’s why it’s critical to support he first responders, the investigators, who are looking into it to determine what did happen.”  What could she possibly think was the cause of the explosion? A brain fart? The difference in the professionalism between these two is beyond me. Hillary Clinton is obviously proving herself to not be well enough to run a country. She just needs to drop out and rest.",fake
"A Marine family in Michigan said goodbye to its beloved K-9 with a fitting funeral. Rico was a Marine K-9 who served two tours in Afghanistan and was part of more than 240 missions and 30 firefights. He lived just over 12 years by the side of his owner, Marine Staff Sgt. Russ Beckley, Jr. “There was not a moment when it wasn’t his mission or his goal to be by my side. I was everything to him. And he was everything to me,” Beckley told WOOD.  After spending more than a year apart, Beckley and Rico were reunited in mid-June at the sergeant’s parents’ home. The dog was in declining health due to age, and the family had made the decision to have him put down. “Mainly I was thinking about how loyal he was to our family. To my son. To myself. And to our country,” Russ Beckley, Sr. said of his last moment with the dog. “He just kinda melted into my arms and we had a very nice goodbye.” Beckley said he “thanked Rico” for everything he’d done for him. “And I told him that I loved him,” he added. The dog then got a proper military send-off, with Beckley lowering his American flag to half-staff and visitors coming to pay their respects at a memorial set up by the family. Beckley and his father -- dressed in their uniforms -- carried their beloved dog in a flag-draped coffin. Beckley said that while it’s hard saying goodbye his beloved dog, he knows it isn’t the last time they’ll be together. “I can just imagine one day, seeing my great grandfather, my grandfather, my father and my mother, standing there with Rico. And we will all be together again,” he said. ",fake
"Washington (CNN)Ivanka Trump will join female Republican House members and senators Tuesday in Washington to promote the GOP nominee's proposals on child care, in a continued effort by father's presidential campaign to reach out to women voters. The highest-ranking female House GOP leader, Washington Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, is hosting the roundtable at the Republican National Committee, according to Donald Trump's campaign and a GOP congressional source. McMorris Rodgers worked closely with Trump's daughter on the plans that were officially unveiled last week at an event in suburban Philadelphia. McMorris Rodgers is the only House member to give birth three times while in office. Ivanka Trump is a top adviser and surrogate for her father's campaign and frequently mentions his record of hiring female executives in top positions in his businesses. As a mother of three Trump did several interviews with national outlets about the campaign's new proposals for paid maternity leave and more affordable child care. But she abruptly ended an interview with Cosmopolitan Magazine when the reporter pressed her on previous comments by Donald Trump on pregnant employees, accusing the interviewer of bias. RELATED: GOP policy guru: Trump can't 'fake his way through 90 minutes' Tuesday's session will cover workplace flexibility, child care, equal pay and the policies the campaign rolled out last week. Trump will also hear from the roughly 15 House members and senators about the issues they are working on in Congress, according to two GOP sources familiar with the plans. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi swiped at Donald Trump's ""disastrous maternity leave and childcare plan"" ahead of the meeting. ""Just like his tax plan, Donald Trump's maternity leave and childcare plan is designed to benefit the wealthy, while leaving hard-working women and families behind,"" Pelosi, a Democrat, said in a statement. ""Unsurprisingly, LGBT families, fathers and adoptive parents have no place in Trump's pinched notion of hard-working America."" The meeting in Washington comes a day after Trump's daughter met with House Speaker Paul Ryan, at her request, during the speaker's visit to New York. RELATED: Clinton's challenge: Rebuilding Obama's winning coalition The recent focus on this set of issues by the GOP nominee comes as polls show the race tightening, but Trump trailing Hillary Clinton among female voters in recent national and battleground state polls. The new proposals from Donald Trump reduce the costs for families by making child care expenses tax deductible for families making less than $500,000. Trump also proposed setting up tax-free accounts to be used for child care and child enrichment activities. He also proposed providing paid maternity leave by extending unemployment insurance benefits to those working mothers whose employers do not offer paid maternity leave. ",true
"Steve Burke, the CEO of NBCUniversal, praised NBC Nightly News anchor Lester Holt for his performance moderating Monday night’s presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. Speaking at the Royal Television Society Conference in London Tuesday, Burke said that Holt “ended up doing a very good job” moderating the debate, according to Deadline. “The environment is so tough right now for anybody moderating anything to try and make sure that it’s a fair debate,” Burke said, adding that he and other NBCU brass were “very worried and concerned for Lester” before the debate began. Burke also estimated that the contentious debate may have been watched by 100 million viewers in the U.S., according to Comcast set-top box data that showed about 35% if U.S. households tuning in. Holt received mixed reactions for moderating the debate between Clinton and Trump, during which he mostly let the candidates hash out the issues without his interference. Trump initially praised Holt for his performance, but by Tuesday morning, he and his surrogates said that Holt unfairly asked Trump “hostile questions” and was not critical enough of Clinton.",true
"If not for the presidency, Bobby Knight is pushing Donald Trump for sainthood. “I actually enjoyed the day with Saint Donald and I've enjoyed watching him. I've really enjoyed watching him, I think go about things the way that he thought things should be.,” the legendary basketball coach said Friday on “Fox & Friends,” echoing a sobriquet he has begun using for the Republican nominee in recent days. “I think the man has a lot of really, really good things to bring to the table.” Story Continued Below Remarking upon Trump’s transformation as a presidential candidate, the famously hot-headed Hall of Fame coach said he was not sure if he would say the boastful businessman has become “milder.” “But I just have seen him take a different approach to how things should be and go about attacking things and what's wrong,” Knight said. “I've really been impressed with the interest that he has in seeing that things are done in the right way.” Asked whether he had discussed the ongoing unrest in Charlotte, North Carolina, after police shot and killed an African-American man, Knight replied, “Not really.” “I mean that's -- you know, what is there to say?” he remarked. “It was wrong. It was—You know, you could go forever. That was not something that we really directed our attention to.” As far as what the two did discuss, Knight made note of Trump’s business records and ability to solve problems. “And that's what I think is the most important thing he brings to this job. The guy is going -- hey, this isn't working, we got to figure out what's wrong with this and we got to get this straightened out,” Knight said. “That, to me, is what being president is all about, and I don't think -- has there ever been a president that hasn't had problems?” The best president at that “might have been Reagan,” Knight said, adding, “that’s what Donald Trump brings to the table.” When it comes to Hillary Clinton’s assertion that Trump lacks the temperament to be commander in chief, Knight invoked his favorite presidents to argue the opposite. “Well, I think that being pretty strong willed is a pretty good asset to have,” he added. “I mean, who had -- has there ever been a president that was better than Harry Truman and Harry Truman had a damn good temperament.”",true
"Washington (CNN)With two months to go before Election Day, Democrats have the cash advantage in the race for the White House, but Republicans have the cash advantage in the race for the Senate. Presidential campaigns and their supportive super PACs filed new numbers Tuesday that continue to show Clinton's cash lead in the homestretch of the presidential race. Clinton's campaign raised $59.5 million and had about $68 million on hand at the end of August; Trump's raised $41.7 million and had $50.2 million on hand. Meanwhile, a cadre of Republican donors -- most prominently, Sheldon Adelson -- are keeping Republicans competitive in down-ballot races. Here are the five takeaways from the money race: Hillary Clinton is very dependent on a few billionaires Under-noticed in this campaign have been the very few Democratic billionaires who are responsible for Clinton's advertising machine: Priorities USA. The super PAC had a record-breaking month, collecting $23.4 million during summer's dog days. The bulk of the money is from a select few: Fred Eychaner and Daniel Abraham, who gave $3 million each, George Soros, who donated $2.5 million, Don Sussman, who kicked in another $2 million, and Laurene Powell Jobs, whose LLC contributed another $2 million. Those five people are responsible for a majority of the money that Priorities USA has raised, and their names have littered Democratic campaign finance reports for the entire 2016 race. Trump doesn't have donors of similar sizes, and that's why his super PACs have failed to keep pace. Only one new name appeared on Trump's PAC's reports: Cherna Moskowitz, who gave $1 million to a group run by close Trump allies (and billionaires) Bob and Rebekah Mercer. What's Clinton's money good for? Ads Clinton has enjoyed a fundraising advantage over Trump for the entire campaign, and it's allowed her to build an organization that Trump could not. The Democratic nominee spent almost $50 million last month -- way more than she spent during any other month -- and that's due to $33 million in ""media buys."" That's more than six times as much as they spent on payroll costs. And her campaign, joint fundraising committees and Priorities USA had $194 million on hand, meaning plenty of more ads are coming. She's still struggling with small donors: only $8.4 million of the money she raised last month if from donors who gave $200 or less. Trump is finally raising the big bucks Despite record spending in the month of August -- including a hefty amount on its digital firm -- Trump still entered the month with over $50 million on hand. Trump collected $12 million from small-dollar donors who gave directly to his campaign, and he himself added another $2 million to his own bid. $20.2 million came from his joint committees with the Republican National Committee. Trump finally began advertising in the month of August, and it's reflected in his campaign finance report. He spent almost $30 million last month, $11.5 million more than he spent in any other month. The return of Mike Bloomberg The former New York City mayor remains the most prominent political donor who hews to the center of the political aisle. His super PAC, Independence USA, has primarily focused on supporting candidates who support restrictions on firearms, and has emerged as a leading backer of Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey. But he personally is backing the Democratic ticket for president. The billionaire last month made his largest donation yet to his group: another $8.5 million from his personal fortune. That's his largest check ever to the super PAC. Senate Republicans have the upper hand Thanks to $21.5 million from the Adelsons, groups backing Senate Republicans have more to spend in the homestretch than do those backing Senate Democrats. The Senate Leadership Fund, an allied group in New Hampshire, and the Koch brothers' super PAC, Freedom Partners Action Fund, raised $32.5 million in August. That also doesn't include various groups that aren't required to disclose their donors, such as the US Chamber of Commerce or other Koch nonprofit groups. And the Democrats? The main Senate groups -- Senate Majority PAC, Emily's List and the League of Conservation Voters -- took in only $20.5 million. Environmental activist Tom Steyer on Tuesday pledged another $15 million to his joint effort with labor unions to develop a coordinated ground game for the Democratic ticket. But here's what we do know now: The Democrats don't have an Adelson equivalent. Their main Senate donor last month is Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, who along with his wife gave $5 million of the $20 million he has pledged to spend in 2016. In the Senate cash race, Adelson is a game-changer. ",true
"The rioting in Charlotte has practically crippled the city. Businesses were looted, windows were smashed. So-called protesters have committed any number of crimes, from arson and assault, to murder. North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory was forced to declare a state of emergency and called in the National Guard to get the situation under control. And now, government officials have had enough too. They just made a huge announcement that will have people thinking twice before they start protesting again.   Officials just released a proclamation that says any people caught rioting, looting, destroying property or otherwise being violent in any unlawful manner will have their government benefits permanently revoked. But it doesn’t end there — any minor children who participate in the violence will face the same repercussions… and so will their parents. The parents of minors caught rioting will not only be held accountable for their child’s actions, but they could face losing their state benefits as well. They could also face referrals to social services and could potentially lose custody of their children. “Parents are responsible for their children. If they are allowing them to engage in lawless behaviors there will be consequences for them as parents,” city official Wilson Stewart said during a press conference. “Many of the individuals we have detained are high school students. We urge parents out there to know where their children are at all times until tensions are quelled. Have them adhere to the mandatory curfew. Make them aware that participation in looting, destruction of property and violently demonstrating on any level will come with severe penalties.”   Will this keep protesters from turning violent? Will it prevent thugs from exploiting a tragic death so they can have an excuse to riot and loot and attack people? Only time will tell, but at least now they will know that there are serious consequences to their actions. Parents may also be more inclined to keep an eye on their kids and you know… act like parents. Let’s be real, if your kid is caught rioting and looting, then there’s a good chance you’re not doing a good job at parenting. Officials have also put a curfew into place as they work to restore peace and order in Charlotte.   ",fake

"Anyone with even a little bit of decency was outraged when GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump decided to tweet out an off the cuff invitation for Gennifer Flowers, the woman who was involved in an extramarital affair scandal with former President Bill Clinton in the 1980s, to be his guest at the first presidential debate. If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2016  The tweet was just another example of Trump’s lashing out when he feels slighted. Well, it seems that the Trump campaign realized what a sleazy and inappropriate move this was on the part of their candidate, and campaign surrogates and officials have been out in force to make sure that the whole world knows that Trump will not have Flowers there as his guest. Trump campaign manager number three and official Trump whisperer Kellyane Conway said of the ruckus: “We do not expect her to be a guest of the Trump campaign.” Conway went on to spew the bullshit excuse that there’s no way that Hillary will ever get under Trump’s skin: “Mr. Trump was putting them on notice that we could certainly invite guests that make it into the head of Hillary Clinton.” The thing is, this is just disgusting. Hillary made the PERSONAL decision to stay with her husband, as many women do, after he had an affair. This nonsense is decades old, and should be in no way relevant to the 2016 race for the White House. This is something that is a low blow, sexist and is in no way appropriate for a serious political campaign. Trump’s flirting with this invitation for Flowers to attend the debate is nothing more than a misogynist attempt to shame a woman for her personal decision to forgive the man she loves for mistakes within a marriage. In other words, it’s not appropriate to drag it up, and it is none of the public’s business. Further, it CERTAINLY has NOTHING to do with the current election. This is just one more example of Trump’s grossly ill-suited temperament when it comes to occupying the highest office in this great land and leading the free world.
